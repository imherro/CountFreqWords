1
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:05,465
Ay, finally!

2
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:08,346
Look who's wearing
her itsy-bitsy bikini.

3
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:10,473
He can comment
because he's gay.

4
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:12,722
He was talking about Lily.
So was I.

5
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:15,478
Ay, Cam,
you make her look so pretty.

6
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,059
Guess who's not coming
for Christmas.

7
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:19,019
And the spotlight shifts. Mom.

8
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,524
- She canceled.
- What?

9
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:22,273
In a voice mail, no less.
Unbelievable.

10
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,108
And by that,
I mean believable.

11
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,864
Why isn't Nana coming?
I don't know.

12
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:29,117
Something about her new boyfriend
whisking her away on a cruise.

13
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:31,616
I just got my gift. What boyfriend?

14
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,245
Carl, the cruise ship captain.

15
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,161
It was in her
holiday newsletter.

16
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:37,838
Oh, I can't read
that whole thing. No.

17
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:39,836
Yeah, after two pages
about the bird she rescued?

18
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:42,794
And by the way, I don't think you can
say you rescued something if it dies.

19
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:45,421
It died? She wrote
a poem about it.

20
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:47,506
A little too free with
the free verse for my taste.

21
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,057
But fine,
we'll call it a poem.

22
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:52,056
I stopped reading after she
talked about suing her book club.

23
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:55,560
Oh, I stopped reading after "Dear
friends, family and others."

24
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,186
I'm sorry. Who are "others"?

25
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,309
Me.  No, you're not-

26
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,395
Uh, maybe you are.

27
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,446
Actually, she's kind of
at her best at Christmas.

28
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:05,024
She makes a mean cookie.

29
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:07,530
What other kind could
she possibly make? Come on.

30
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:11,580
A y, it's so sad that you guys are not
gonna be with your mom this Christmas.

31
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,244
It's fine. Yeah,
it's more than fine.

32
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:15,914
Let's just- Can we move off of Mom?
Yes, please.

33
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,495
Yeah, and the upside now,
Mitchell,

34
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,080
we can spend Christmas
in Missouri,

35
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:21,415
where it actually feels
like Christmas.

36
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,375
Wait, hang on a second.
Just because Mom isn't coming ...

37
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:26,086
doesn't mean we're not gonna
spend Christmas together.

38
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,716
I mean, it's about family.

39
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,764
Who do you think we're seeing
in Missouri? The Oak Ridge Boys?

40
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,343
Hold on. I thought we were all gettin'
together Christmas Eve this year.

41
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,269
We're on a flight to Mexico
the 25th.

42
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,688
What do you mean, you're getting
on a flight on the 25th?

43
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,265
You two needed time
with your morn.

44
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,271
I've already served my time
with your mom.

45
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,274
- Oh, Dad.
- Well, when are we gonna have Christmas, then?

46
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:46,615
I heard kids are getting
snatched in Mexico. What?

47
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,613
Kids get snatched here
just as much.

48
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,285
It happens all the time.
Don't be scared.

49
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,283
And when you say
"all the time"-

50
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,864
Okay, well, what about
next weekend?

51
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,449
'Cause we don't leave
till the 21st, right?

52
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,626
Yeah, we leave tomorrow. We
don't come back until the 21st.

53
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:00,170
Hey, math club, could you
get me some more lemonade?

54
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:03,294
Are we saying that this is the last time we're
all going to be together as a family ...

55
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,875
until after the holidays?

56
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,881
And for you, maybe ever.

57
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,633
- Well, this stinks.
- Yeah. We can't do this!

58
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,635
- We always spend Christmas together.
- Who dreamed this up?

59
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,307
Yeah, we have
to do something about it.

60
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:17,058
Ho, ho, hold up a sec.
We're all free today.

61
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,856
We've got four hours to shop,
cook, wrap, get a tree.

62
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:23,026
By tonight, we could be
celebrating Christmas, right?

63
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,145
I guess we could do that.
Of course we can.

64
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,650
Have you ever heard
of express Christmas?

65
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,900
No. No, you haven't, because
I just invented it.

66
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,780
Express Christmas, T.M.

67
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,495
It's when you can't have it on
Christmas day- Yeah, we got it.

68
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,535
Get on with it. We're wasting time!
We're wasting time!

69
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:38,868
Everyone in the house! We'll make a plan!
Time is of the-

70
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,829
Ow! Hot! Hot!
That's just too hot!

71
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,459
Oh, Phil!

72
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:52,177
# Hey, hey #

73
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,427
# Hey ##

74
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:56,685
So we're really
doin' this, huh?

75
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,852
Yes, Dad. Let's go.

76
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,771
'Cause I had stuff lined
up for Christmas Eve.

77
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,567
Yeah, Jay, it's Manny's last chance
to enjoy a family Christmas.

78
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,110
Until next year,
you mean.

79
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,233
Well,
with all the snatchings-

80
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,064
Get out of my head, Luke.

81
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,533
Okay, who's gonna get the tree?
Oh, Oh, I will, I will.

82
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,952
Because, you know, get the wrong
kind, people get upset.

83
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,946
You get upset.
I'm people.

84
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,123
Fine. I'll get the turkey.
What about gifts?

85
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,450
Jay, did we finish shopping?

86
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,830
Yeah, but
we're not wrapped.

87
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,752
I can help with that. We have
a mobile wrapping station.

88
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,205
God, has that thing
paid for itself.

89
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,789
Really? 'Cause I feel
like I paid for it.

90
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,500
Okay. We've got lights and
ornaments at our place.

91
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,719
Oh, you know what'd be great
is the angel. The angel!

92
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:31,886
Yeah, where is it'?

93
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,555
Gloria, it's up in your attic.
Would you get it?

94
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,303
A y, no,
not the attic!

95
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,056
It's dirty, and
there are spiders.

96
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,887
Oh, but it really won't
be Christmas without it.

97
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,564
It won't be Christmas with it.
it's December 16.

98
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,437
Luke will help Gloria.
He's not scared.

99
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,644
Oh, good. You won't
find me in any attic.

100
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:50,527
- That might be exactly where they find you.
- Mom!

101
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:54,030
Uh, I have a party tonight. You promised
I could go if I got a "B" on my test.

102
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,407
I studied. I read stuff. What
was the point of all that?

103
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,701
The point, young lady,
was- Who can remember?

104
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,908
Express Christmas
will be done by 9:00.

105
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,534
Claire, I'll text you the gift list.
Okay.

106
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,085
You and Haley
do the shopping.

107
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:06,539
Manny, you're coming with me.
We're gonna get groceries.

108
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,498
Dinner, our house, 6:00.

109
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,175
Let's move!

110
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,551
On Dasher, on Dancer,
on Prancer and Vixen!

111
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,257
Hey, that kind of worked out.

112
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,850
- Jay.
- Come on, Haley.

113
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,969
Jay, you are gonna love this
wrapping- it'll be fun.

114
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,646
A lot of fun.
We can go to Target, okay?

115
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,474
- Let's go. Let's go!
- Let's go!

116
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,527
So it's just me and Lily
getting the tree, then?

117
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,525
Hello?
Hello?

118
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,446
My mom tells me
it's "Xmas" in a text?

119
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,198
Yeah, well, my mom canceled
in a voice mail ...

120
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,952
and told me she had a boyfriend in
a newsletter, so ... join the team.

121
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,453
Put some clothes on.
We're gettin' a tree.

122
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,377
Sweetie, come on.

123
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,878
Luke!
At what?

124
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,584
What do you mean, at what?
I said "Luke."

125
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,715
I am looking.

126
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,297
I know you are.

127
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,926
Stay on the beams.

128
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,508
Maybe it's here.

129
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,516
Ay, dios mio!
El diablo is back!

130
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,525
What is so special
about that angel, anyways?

131
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,102
I don't know.

132
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,654
I guess Nana made it for Morn and
Uncle Mitchell when they were kids.

133
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,107
Ay, that's nice.

134
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,533
0w!

135
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:19,657
- Look where you're going!
- To open more boxes.

136
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,907
Ay-

137
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,084
Oh, you said, "Look where
you're going," didn't you?

138
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,378
Yes.

139
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,797
Every time you said "Luke,"
I think you're saying "Look."

140
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,713
I don't hear the difference.
it's not that hard.

141
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:34,918
One is my name.

142
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,548
Juan is not your name!

143
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,630
Stop kidding around
and look, Luke.

144
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:43,101
Ay, I get it!
"Look" sounds like "Luke."

145
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,928
Yes.
Thank God.

146
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,265
I've been carrying that one
around for three years.

147
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,315
There's, like, a
hundred things on this list.

148
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:54,738
I know. But it's just the two of us.
it's fun.

149
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,815
Okay, it's not
fake Mother's Day.

150
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:01,495
Oh, this place is huge!
Oh, plus we have to cook dinner!

151
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,955
This is impossible.
Listen to me.

152
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:08,286
Your whole life
has led to this moment.

153
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,713
All the training,
the hours of dedication.

154
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,792
There's not a soul alive who can
touch you when it comes to shopping.

155
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,003
And baby, you know it.
Look at me.

156
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,968
Be you.

157
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:24,517
Give me that list. Never
been more proud in my life.

158
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,095
Come on.
No!

159
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,019
This way.

160
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,566
What about this one?
Let's see.

161
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,568
No, no. I'm sorry. I know I'm
really being O.C.D. right now,

162
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,116
but there's something very
particular that I'm looking for.

163
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:44,412
It needs to be a Douglas fir at least eight
feet tall and look good from all sides.

164
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,739
Exactly.
No bald spots.

165
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,495
Yes.
Thank you, thank you.

166
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,872
The key is symmetry,
rig ht?

167
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:53,672
# Oh, symmetfy
Oh, symmetry #

168
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,215
How come we never
go shopping together?

169
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:56,925
Because I hate shopping.
I do too!

170
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,544
Huh.
Okay, this one.

171
00:06:58,627 --> 00:06:59,674
Wait.

172
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,262
Oh.
Oh, no, no, no, no.

173
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:02,931
I think I know
what you're lookin' for,

174
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,475
and we just got a shipment
that might be perfect for you.

175
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,263
Okay. Wow.

176
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,769
Just because my uncle
is clearly gay ...

177
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,601
doesn't mean he'd ever want
your tacky pink tree.

178
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,028
And frankly, we'd rather throw
some lights on a coat rack ...

179
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,733
than have to deal with knuckle-draggers
like you today of all clays.

180
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,988
December 16.

181
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:26,038
Okay, first of all,
amazing.

182
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,407
Second of all-
I was pointin' to the truck.

183
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,869
It's full of eight-foot Douglas firs.
it's behind the pink tree.

184
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,875
Yeah. Second of all-

185
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:37,295
Uh, we're gonna go ahead and-and
take, uh, this- this tree. That one.

186
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,843
And we're going to tie it
onto our car ourselves.

187
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,170
You bet you will.

188
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:43,805
I have two daddies.
He gets it, Lily.

189
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,881
Yeah.

190
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,596
Oh, finger.

191
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,189
All right. Mmm.
Cam and Jay.

192
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,187
You know, sort of sounds
like a bird.

193
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,361
"The migratory patterns of
the Cam-and-Jay."

194
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,154
Got any more tape
in that thing?

195
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,823
Do I have more tape in that?

196
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,491
I got a tank full of tape,
mister.

197
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,819
What do you want? Invisible?
Satin finish?

198
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,446
Uh, double-sided?
Whatever, whatever.

199
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,076
Okay.

200
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,703
Well, that's interesting. I
doubt that it is, but what?

201
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:18,632
Well, I mean, the way you wrap a gift.
It's a lot of tape.

202
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:22,086
Nobody can get in.
Kind of like, you know-

203
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:27,258
I mean, well, you let me in.
But in general, why-

204
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,551
Why so much tape, Jay?

205
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,012
Why are you wearing a sweater
when it's 95 degrees out?

206
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,018
It's my Christmas sweater.

207
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,191
Based on those stains, you
are the Christmas sweater.

208
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,442
Well, who's
been a very good boy?

209
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,238
Mmm. So-

210
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,542
Okay, are we gonna talk about
the elephant in the room?

211
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,040
Which is ironic,
because it's so tiny.

212
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,669
A man doesn't give another
man a gift this small.

213
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:02,001
Oh, what do you think it is?
A ring?

214
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,174
Uh, was there wine
with this cork?

215
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,055
Yes, there was,
and we drank it on-

216
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,432
Well, we drank it on-
Yeah.

217
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,809
Um, on that boat.

218
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:17,895
You have no idea.

219
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,022
I can't even remember
my own anniversary, Cam.

220
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,947
How would I have remembered having
had wine with my son's boyfriend?

221
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,945
No, I do this.
This is my fault.

222
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,527
L- I attach too much
meaning to things.

223
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,285
I mean, we watched our first football
game together five years ago,

224
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:35,367
and I feel the need to save the cork
from the bottle of wine you served.

225
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,667
I mean, who does that?

226
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,245
It's not your only gift,
by the way.

227
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,296
There's a duplicate bottle
in that box right over there,

228
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:44,717
which I had engraved with the date and the
final score, because I have a problem!

229
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,420
I feel too much!
I gotta get goin' to Claire's.

230
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,177
- Cam-
- No! Fresh wound! Can't talk yet.

231
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,007
Fine.
We'll put a cork in it.

232
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:54,846
Let it scab, Jay.
Let it scab.

233
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,938
Oh, there you are.
I thought I'd lost you.

234
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,774
Oh, sorry. I may have taken a
few minutes to try out a futon.

235
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,360
It's a young woman's game.
Okay, where do we stand?

236
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,112
I think we have everything. Yes!

237
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,869
Oh, except the ladybug
night-light for Lily.

238
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,122
Haley, your
whole life has led-

239
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,837
I got it, Mom. I got it. Okay,
great, I'll see you in line.

240
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,262
Yes, Ronald.

241
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,723
I not only found it,
I got the last one.

242
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,652
Yes, the ladybug,
not the turtle.

243
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,104
I also got the doll, so I'm all set.
I'm gonna leave in five.

244
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,832
Or maybe I just want paper. Paper. Paper.
Just paper all the way. Yeah.

245
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,079
Haley!

246
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,663
Too late to change my mind?

247
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,839
Sir, would you like me to hold your
merchandise up at the register ...

248
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:08,918
while you
finish shopping?

249
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,879
Oh, aren't you a dream?

250
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,345
Pack of gum.

251
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:23,608
And ... one more pack of gum.

252
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:28,147
People drop in
this time of year, you know.

253
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,323
'Scuse me. Sorry.
Pardon me. Sorry.

254
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,866
'Scuse me.

255
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,239
Night-light you were looking for, ma'am.
Ring her up, Madison.

256
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,071
Thank you.

257
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,615
There you go.

258
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,619
You're leaving me
alone here?

259
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,579
No, no, no, no.
I- it'll, uh-

260
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,164
it'll just take me
two minutes.

261
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,420
I need to get Jay's
super-secret special gift.

262
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,342
Great. First you lose me
in the grocery store.

263
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,295
Now I'm in
a deserted parking lot.

264
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,972
Why don't you just put a sign
on me that says "Free kid"?

265
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,425
I think that might be him.

266
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,223
You don't know the guy we're meeting?
That's how Craigslist works.

267
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:02,101
Total strangers sell you things like
signed vintage baseball cards ...

268
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,433
that make your father-in-law
respect you for an afternoon.

269
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,609
I don't like
the looks of this guy.

270
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,311
He looks
like everybody else.

271
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,988
Great. You can just tell that
to the police sketch artist.

272
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,487
Joe DiMaggio?

273
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,739
Phil Dunphy,
but I get that a lot.

274
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,536
Kidding.
I'm your guy.

275
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,122
Can I see the cash?
Yes.

276
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:21,916
Can I-
Can I see the card?

277
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,539
Mint condition.

278
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,090
That's why I want
another 50.

279
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,712
I only have the 200.

280
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:33,671
- Ah, deal's off then.
- Come on, it's Christmas.

281
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,762
At our house.
it's a long story.

282
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,344
- 225.
- I just spent all my cash on groceries.

283
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,271
- Fine. But I'm taking the Butterball.
- I don't know about that.

284
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,816
- That's it. I'm getting mother's little helper.
- What?

285
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,939
- My mom keeps a stun gun for emergencies.
- This isn't an emergen-

286
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,826
Now it is!

287
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,791
I thought he was
going to snatch me!

288
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:07,336
A Butterball is a tur-

289
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:10,541
- What'd he say?
- I think he said, "A Butterball is a turkey."

290
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,172
I was reaching for the turkey.

291
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,800
Oh. Well, we can't
give you our turkey.

292
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,722
Yes, we can.

293
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,884
Here's the ... money.

294
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,100
Yeah, buddy.
Joe DiMaggi-

295
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,356
Joe DiMagg-

296
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:40,119
Mint conditi-

297
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,617
Near mint condi-

298
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,748
Fair conditi-

299
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,293
Garbage.

300
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,762
Huh,
never saw this before.

301
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,594
"An angel for my angels.
Love, Mom."

302
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,645
A y, that's beautiful.

303
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:10,063
And it smells like mothballs,
just like Nana. Luke.

304
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,527
Th-Thank you. M-Merry Christmas.
Just give it up.

305
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,604
Yeah.

306
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:17,448
He hates us.
Don't beat yourself up.

307
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,321
I do that,
like, once a week.

308
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,404
The good news is, we never
have to come back here.

309
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:23,739
Watch out!

310
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,408
The tree! I can't watch!

311
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,752
Look.
Ay, yes, I said "Luke."

312
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,746
You told me already. I did it right.
No! Look!

313
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,298
¡Ay!

314
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,297
Never look back.
Never!

315
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:40,926
Maybe we can salvage it?

316
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:47,812
Are you okay, papi?

317
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,273
Yeah.
Good.

318
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,191
That's because we had
our guardian angel-

319
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,234
AM a spider!

320
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,324
Hey, Morn.
Check it!

321
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,077
The gum!

322
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,125
Oh, and you made it pretty.
Honey, put it on the table.

323
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,669
- New tradition?
- Oh, yes. Yes.

324
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:15,840
Mmm. Christmas gum. I take one.

325
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,419
Tough to decorate the tree
with no tree, huh?

326
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,300
Mm-hmm, yeah.

327
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,840
How long you gonna
ignore me, Cam?

328
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,096
Until the shame cloud
clears.

329
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,098
You know, I push.
I'm a pusher.

330
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:32,523
You gotta give yourself a break. See, the thing
about me, I'm not as open with feelings as you.

331
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,518
You've gotta lower
your expectations.

332
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,229
Oh, I get it.
Baby steps.

333
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,815
No steps. This is it.

334
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,447
See? Did it again. Push,
push, push, push, push.

335
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:46,029
Now I've pushed you out of the room.
That's- That's fine.

336
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,658
How is she? I got the
tire marks off her wings,

337
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,413
but I can't get her head
to stay on.

338
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,836
Okay.
That's what this is for.

339
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:58,792
Now, stick it in the top of the tree
with the good part facing out. Go on.

340
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:02,345
Oh, that stuffing looks good. All we
need now is a turkey to surround it.

341
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,549
Well, relax. Phil just texted,
and he's on his "wax."

342
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,968
Okay.
Here comes the tree.

343
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,348
Finally.

344
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:11,896
Here comes
more of the tree.

345
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,223
Hi, honey.

346
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,774
Oh, my gosh.
What happened?

347
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,317
Well, uh,
someone ran over it.

348
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:19,904
But that's okay, 'cause we are gonna
put it back together. Right now.

349
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,652
It's gonna need
a lot of gum.

350
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,859
Oh, thank God. Here comes
Phil and the Butterball.

351
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,614
I have a name!
Huh?

352
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,287
I am sorry,
but there is no turkey.

353
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,660
There's no turkey?
What's the plan, Phil?

354
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,663
Cornish game hens.

355
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:36,997
If you get real close, they look like
turkeys, and everyone gets their own.

356
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,502
- Sounds like fun.
- Not fun. Not fun.

357
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,256
I asked you to pick up
a cooked turkey.

358
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,679
The store was out of turkeys. It
was an hour to express Christmas.

359
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:47,098
Please just make it work, okay?
Please.

360
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,766
Not even defrosted.

361
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,264
- Fine, Claire! You want 'em defrosted?
- Yeah.

362
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,938
Merry ... freaking ... Christmas!

363
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,765
No!

364
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:57,942
Is that my stun gun?

365
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,686
Yep, and it works great!

366
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,438
Okay, okay.

367
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,775
Um, we can make this work.
This can work.

368
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,031
- Dad, you and Mitchell reassemble that tree.
- All right.

369
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,114
And I am going to defrost these birds.
We'll cook 'em in shifts,

370
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,915
and we'll just push
dinner back by a bit.

371
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,413
Oh, how long? 'Cause I
still have my party.

372
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,621
- What the hell happened to the angel?
- No!

373
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:21,333
The real question here is how come
we still have the dog butler?

374
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,507
Oh, you found him, huh?

375
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,211
Well, this thing is-
it's filthy and-

376
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,887
What happened?

377
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,806
It got run over.

378
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:32,135
Probably by the same maniac
who ran over the tree.

379
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,437
Oh, my God, is that?
Yep, that's gum.

380
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,606
That is gum.
Okay, I'm- I'm out.

381
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:40,402
I'm done. I am out.
No, no turkey, no tree,

382
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,319
and now this looks like
the lady she used to be ...

383
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,193
before she died
and became an angel.

384
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,616
All right, relax, Mitchell.
it's an ornament.

385
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:50,036
No, he's right. We're never gonna get this together.
I'm goin' to my party.

386
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:52,079
No, no. No, you're not. You are not.
You're staying right here,

387
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,873
because you're not going to
abandon your family on Christmas.

388
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:55,871
It's not Christmas.

389
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,744
Exactly, exactly.
Right. it's not.

390
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,495
It's not Christmas, Claire.
it's not Christmas.

391
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,252
Okay, fine. Fine.
You know what?

392
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,209
I am really tired of trying to
make this work on my own.

393
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:07,796
- I will see you people in a year.
- And nine days.

394
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:11,098
No! Nobody goes anywhere.

395
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,551
I know what the problem is here.

396
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,262
You two miss your mommy.

397
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,227
I do not miss my mommy.

398
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:21,184
Admit it.
it's sad.

399
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:24,020
She used to make you
cookies, the angel.

400
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,481
Now, she talks to you
in a newsletter,

401
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,532
and she cancels
for no reason.

402
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:33,205
- Come here, my little ones.
- No, it's fine. We're good. It's not a big deal.

403
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,032
It's Christmas.
You need a mommy.

404
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,583
You're not our mommy.

405
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:39,831
And it's not Christmas.

406
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,628
Come here.

407
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,377
It's okay to miss her.

408
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,801
Can I put in my two cents
on fake Christmas?

409
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:50,050
- Express Christmas.
- Let it go, Phil. It's not sticking.

410
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,223
It needs time.

411
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,892
We all gave it our best shot
to make this thing work.

412
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,719
It just didn't happen,
all right?

413
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,679
What do you say
we cut our losses?

414
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:01,141
Let's go out to
a nice Chinese restaurant ...

415
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,772
and have a traditional
Jewish Christmas.

416
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,819
But I risked my life
grocery shopping.

417
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,522
Save that story
for Wang Fu.

418
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,699
Now, let's go. Come on, everybody.
On me!

419
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,401
Gut!
Verybody Out!

420
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,574
Dad, no. M.S.G.  Wang Fu.
it's on me. Let's go!

421
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,327
- Come on, baby girl.
- Guys, there's always next year.

422
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,998
- Come on, honey.
- This stinks.

423
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:25,923
We have the snow!

424
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:30,845
Dad!
Aw!

425
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,048
You hate Chinese food.

426
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:39,809
Not bad, huh?

427
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:43,650
Jay, Jay, Jay. You want
to hug me, don't you?

428
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,518
I kinda do.
Four to five seconds.

429
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,771
Forty-five seconds?
Four to five seconds.

430
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,696
Oh, okay.

431
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,025
- Hey, buddy.
- Look at me!

432
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,032
Family is family.

433
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,864
Whether it's the one
you start out with-

434
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,411
Hi, Mom. Merry Christmas.
Hi, Mom.

435
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,537
Thank you. So, um, tell us
everything about the new boyfriend.

436
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,163
Oh, yeah.
Don't leave anything out.

437
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,543
Mmm. You can leave
some things out.

438
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,340
The one that
you end up with-

439
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,467
Or the family that you
gain along the way.

440
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,140
Do this!
Snow angels!

441
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:27,526
Which makes every day
December 16.

442
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,570
It's good.

443
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,243
Hey, Jay, um, I'm sorry about
the baseball card.

444
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,195
L-I did get you a-
a backup gift.

445
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,697
It's- it's nothing. Oh.

446
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,407
I picked it up
when we stopped for gas.

447
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:44,577
Dog antlers.
I know.

448
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,458
You got us snow,
and I got you dog antlers.

449
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,756
- I love these.
- I thought you might.

450
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:51,550
Honey, look, come here.
There we go.

451
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,377
There.

452
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:56,260
How cute is that?
Where's my camera?

453
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,806
Gloria, you gotta see this!

454
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,600
Come on, Stella!
Gloria!

455
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:02,596
Dog antlers.
He loves dog antlers.

456
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,772
Oh, no. Oh, okay.

457
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,690
Oh.
Oh, gosh.

458
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,814
You okay? Oh!

459
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,481
I'm so sorry.
