1
00:00:02,004 --> 00:00:04,590
Jay.

2
00:00:06,258 --> 00:00:08,051
Jay. What? What's wrong?

3
00:00:08,177 --> 00:00:10,762
You're snoring.
Me?

4
00:00:10,846 --> 00:00:13,098
Oh, I'm sorry. I-

5
00:00:13,182 --> 00:00:15,184
Hey.

6
00:00:15,267 --> 00:00:17,561
Look at her.

7
00:00:17,644 --> 00:00:20,022
Come on. We said
no Stella in the bed.

8
00:00:20,105 --> 00:00:21,690
Oh, but she's just
a little puppy.

9
00:00:21,773 --> 00:00:23,942
She probably got scared
and snuck in.

10
00:00:24,026 --> 00:00:25,652
Oh, really? How come when
Manny has nightmares,

11
00:00:25,736 --> 00:00:27,362
you don't let him
snuck in the bed?

12
00:00:27,446 --> 00:00:29,865
Gloria, it's 6:00 in the morning.
Can we talk about this later?

13
00:00:31,325 --> 00:00:33,619
Answer the question, Jay.

14
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,207
You know, I'm going to check the lease,
but I'm pretty sure...

15
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:39,791
we're not allowed to have
a meth lab.

16
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,335
You are a delight.

17
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,795
So what are you doing? I think
you're gonna like this.

18
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:45,714
I'm going on a juice fast.

19
00:00:45,797 --> 00:00:47,341
Mmm.
Love it.

20
00:00:47,424 --> 00:00:48,926
Hate it.

21
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:53,263
Let's face it. A well-fed Cam is
hardly a model of emotional stability.

22
00:00:53,347 --> 00:00:55,057
Now, deprive him of food,

23
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,560
and stage by stage, it's
a slow descent into madness.

24
00:00:58,644 --> 00:01:00,646
Stage one- the clean sweep.

25
00:01:01,563 --> 00:01:05,192
Poison. Poison. Poison.

26
00:01:05,317 --> 00:01:08,487
Do you think this is the best
week to be doing this? Why not?

27
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,656
Well, we have that charity thing
at my boss's house.

28
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:12,741
So what? I'm supposed to
put off my quest for wellness...

29
00:01:12,824 --> 00:01:14,534
until we're no longer
socially in demand?

30
00:01:14,618 --> 00:01:16,662
That will never happen.
I'm too charismatic.

31
00:01:16,745 --> 00:01:18,205
No. No, not the cookies!

32
00:01:18,288 --> 00:01:20,290
Of course the cookies.

33
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:23,168
Why do you always
want me to fail?

34
00:01:23,252 --> 00:01:25,170
Stage two- attack Mitchell,

35
00:01:25,254 --> 00:01:27,923
because when his diet
crashes and burns...

36
00:01:28,006 --> 00:01:30,008
into a giant pile of Nutella,

37
00:01:30,092 --> 00:01:31,593
I'm the one
he's going to blame.

38
00:01:31,677 --> 00:01:33,428
Well, no, not this time.

39
00:01:33,512 --> 00:01:35,389
You know what?
I'm gonna do the fast with you.

40
00:01:35,472 --> 00:01:37,224
I think it's a great idea.

41
00:01:37,307 --> 00:01:39,309
And we should do it together,
so we're on the same team.

42
00:01:39,393 --> 00:01:40,894
You know, us versus food.

43
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:42,938
I know what you're doing.

44
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:44,606
And I really appreciate it.

45
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,276
Oh, no. It'll-
it'll be good for me.

46
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:48,860
I've actually
put on a few pounds, so-

47
00:01:48,944 --> 00:01:50,737
Yeah, well- I didn't
want to say anything.

48
00:01:55,993 --> 00:01:58,829
As the stock market plummeted,

49
00:01:58,912 --> 00:02:01,331
brave young men
took to the skies,

50
00:02:01,415 --> 00:02:05,585
ushering in
the golden age of the daredevil.

51
00:02:05,669 --> 00:02:07,629
How awesome are people?

52
00:02:07,713 --> 00:02:10,173
So awesome.

53
00:02:10,257 --> 00:02:13,010
You want
to get that, buddy? I'll pause it

54
00:02:14,386 --> 00:02:15,887
Hey, Luke.
How's it goin'?

55
00:02:15,971 --> 00:02:18,473
Hey, Uncle Mitchell. I really can't talk.
I'm tryin' to watch a movie.

56
00:02:18,557 --> 00:02:21,518
Oh, okay. Well, I just wanted to
drop off this bag of junk food.

57
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:23,020
Go on.

58
00:02:23,103 --> 00:02:25,856
Uh, Cam and I
are on a juice fast,

59
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:27,441
so having the stuff
in the house just-

60
00:02:27,524 --> 00:02:29,735
I connected the dots.
See ya.

61
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:30,902
Uh-

62
00:02:36,575 --> 00:02:41,038
Seeing that weird, wonderful little man
pursuing his dream of walking on a tightrope...

63
00:02:41,121 --> 00:02:44,541
made me think maybe I
could pursue my dream.

64
00:02:44,624 --> 00:02:46,293
There you go, buddy.

65
00:02:50,339 --> 00:02:52,507
Of walking on a tightrope.

66
00:02:53,342 --> 00:02:55,177
# Hey, hey #

67
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,304
# Hey, hey #

68
00:02:57,387 --> 00:02:59,389
# Hey, hey #

69
00:02:59,473 --> 00:03:01,350
# Hey, hey #

70
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:02,601
# Hey ##

71
00:03:05,103 --> 00:03:07,522
Come on, Dad! You got this!
You can do this!

72
00:03:07,606 --> 00:03:09,066
Stay focused,
stay hungry!

73
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:10,692
You okay, buddy?
What? Yeah!

74
00:03:10,776 --> 00:03:13,028
Yeah, no, just proud of my dad!

75
00:03:13,111 --> 00:03:15,280
There was a lot of chocolate
in that bag.

76
00:03:16,406 --> 00:03:19,451
Phil- Honey, you gotta
take Luke to school.

77
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:20,827
Got it.

78
00:03:20,911 --> 00:03:23,663
Okay, I haven't fallen three
out of the last four times.

79
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:26,291
This afternoon, we go airborne.
Yeah.

80
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,210
Yeah!
Yeah!

81
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:32,756
Yeah! Mmm!
Yeah!

82
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,968
Sitting all by
yourself at the table.

83
00:03:37,052 --> 00:03:39,054
Now, where have I
seen that again?

84
00:03:39,137 --> 00:03:41,848
Oh, right. Every day in
the school cafeteria.

85
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:43,975
I do that by choice.
School's choice.

86
00:03:44,101 --> 00:03:46,895
Isn't that your nickname? Haley!
Be nice to your sister.

87
00:03:46,978 --> 00:03:48,814
Alex- Good save.

88
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:51,400
Mom, sign this.
What is it?

89
00:03:51,483 --> 00:03:53,360
They finally bumped me up
to the harder math class.

90
00:03:53,443 --> 00:03:54,903
Third period, Mr. Waters.

91
00:03:54,986 --> 00:03:57,823
What? No, Mom. You cannot sign this.
This is my class.

92
00:03:57,906 --> 00:04:00,075
You're a freshman. What are you
doing in second-year math?

93
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:02,577
You're a senior. What are you
still doing in second-year math?

94
00:04:02,661 --> 00:04:04,454
Not still. Again.

95
00:04:04,538 --> 00:04:06,164
Alex, be nice to your sister.

96
00:04:06,248 --> 00:04:08,125
Haley, not a good save.

97
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,168
I knew it would suck
having you at my school.

98
00:04:10,252 --> 00:04:11,753
Well, hang in there.
A couple more years,

99
00:04:11,837 --> 00:04:13,296
you'll have it all
to yourself again.

100
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,965
Come on, girls.

101
00:04:16,174 --> 00:04:18,260
Jay, look at this.

102
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:21,680
It's ruined!
Stella did this.

103
00:04:21,763 --> 00:04:23,265
She chew on my shoe.

104
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:24,850
You have to discipline
that stupid dog.

105
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:26,476
I discipline her all the time.

106
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,478
Oh, really? How?
By buying her little cupcakes?

107
00:04:28,562 --> 00:04:31,731
They're not real cupcakes. They're
doggie treats in the form of cupcakes.

108
00:04:31,815 --> 00:04:34,276
Yeah. You should've told that
to Manny before he ate one.

109
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:37,195
Ah, come on. His coat never looked better.

110
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:40,407
You wouldn't find this so funny
if she was destroying your shoes.

111
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,659
Well, I don't leave my shoes
laying around, so-

112
00:04:42,742 --> 00:04:45,954
So it's my fault that
she chooses to chew my shoe?

113
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:48,165
I didn't say that.
You barely said it.

114
00:04:48,248 --> 00:04:51,001
- You have to stop coddling her.
- I don't coddle her.

115
00:04:54,921 --> 00:04:56,423
What?

116
00:04:56,506 --> 00:05:00,719
She tries to drink the water.
it's funny!

117
00:05:00,802 --> 00:05:04,431
You don't look at me in class.
You don't text me.

118
00:05:04,514 --> 00:05:06,725
Who would text
during a class?

119
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:09,102
What are you?

120
00:05:09,186 --> 00:05:12,689
Honey, I realize that this situation
is not ideal for either one of you,

121
00:05:12,772 --> 00:05:15,400
but sometimes we just
rise above things.

122
00:05:15,484 --> 00:05:16,985
Yes?

123
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:20,071
Excuse me. Did you notice the
curb here is painted yellow?

124
00:05:20,155 --> 00:05:21,656
Uh, no, I did not.

125
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,075
Wow. It means
"loading and unloading."

126
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:26,453
Okay. Well, I was just
dropping off my kids.

127
00:05:26,536 --> 00:05:28,580
And yet, I see no kids
emerging from the vehicle.

128
00:05:28,705 --> 00:05:31,416
Well, we were chatting.
Wow.

129
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,921
At the risk of surprising you a third time,
Officer, I've been dropping off here for years-

130
00:05:36,046 --> 00:05:37,506
Move it.
Okay. You betcha.

131
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:39,591
What was her problem?

132
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:41,176
You know what you
should have said to her?

133
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:43,345
Nothing. I should have said nothing.
What would be the point?

134
00:05:43,428 --> 00:05:45,931
I have to see her every day.
I mean, why make it worse?

135
00:05:46,014 --> 00:05:47,599
That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

136
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:50,936
Awkward, unpleasant situation?
Rise above.

137
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,313
Have a nice day.

138
00:05:53,438 --> 00:05:55,690
Yeah.
Love you.

139
00:05:55,774 --> 00:05:57,609
Bye-bye.

140
00:06:01,363 --> 00:06:04,241
"And yet I see no
children emerging from the vehicle."

141
00:06:04,324 --> 00:06:06,910
How would you like to
see my fist emerging into your face?

142
00:06:06,993 --> 00:06:09,079
Oh! Now I think of it!

143
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:14,042
Day four of the juice fast,

144
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:17,212
and I'm hungry,
but I'm feelin' pretty good.

145
00:06:17,295 --> 00:06:21,716
Cam, on the other hand,
has gone all Girl, Interrupted

146
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,095
After one, throwing out all of
our food, and two, blaming me,

147
00:06:25,178 --> 00:06:28,765
he entered stage three-
soap actress.

148
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:31,726
I just wish my sister
would put herself out there more.

149
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,354
She has so much to offer!

150
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:37,065
Why are men so superficial?

151
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:41,528
That was followed by stage
four- a rush of epiphanies.

152
00:06:41,611 --> 00:06:44,239
I don't need food.

153
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:47,742
Look at this.
Architecture's everywhere.

154
00:06:47,826 --> 00:06:50,745
Oh, Spaniards make
amazing athletes.

155
00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:53,164
Into stage five- despair.

156
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:59,129
Daddy, we hided,
but you didn't seek.

157
00:06:59,963 --> 00:07:00,922
Cam?

158
00:07:01,006 --> 00:07:02,215
Then came rage.

159
00:07:03,592 --> 00:07:05,802
Ow! Ah.

160
00:07:09,472 --> 00:07:11,057
Hey.
Whatcha got there?

161
00:07:11,141 --> 00:07:16,146
The good news is, Cam's never made
it this far into a diet before, so-

162
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:20,108
Downside? I have no idea what
the next stage is gonna be.

163
00:07:20,191 --> 00:07:22,777
But I'm pretty sure
it's not charming party guest.

164
00:07:22,861 --> 00:07:26,197
Cam, I-l was thinking, I'll take the
bullet tomorrow night at my boss's house.

165
00:07:26,281 --> 00:07:27,907
You don't have to go
to the party.

166
00:07:29,326 --> 00:07:30,952
Th-They're boring.

167
00:07:31,036 --> 00:07:33,121
Some... silly cause.

168
00:07:33,204 --> 00:07:34,748
You know,
lots of people.

169
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:37,334
Parking.

170
00:07:38,418 --> 00:07:40,420
- Cam, say something.
- Why do you hate me?

171
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:43,381
- I don't hate you.
- Then why are you trying to push me out of your life?

172
00:07:43,465 --> 00:07:45,550
Because you seem a little...

173
00:07:47,344 --> 00:07:48,511
unhinged.

174
00:07:48,595 --> 00:07:49,929
Okay. You know what I think?

175
00:07:50,013 --> 00:07:51,640
You should worry
a little bit less about me...

176
00:07:51,723 --> 00:07:54,225
and a little bit more about yourself and
what you're gonna wear tomorrow night,

177
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:55,977
because I saw
what you have laid out,

178
00:07:56,061 --> 00:07:58,772
and I don't think you're gonna
like the way you look in photos.

179
00:08:00,315 --> 00:08:02,275
I hadn't landed on that.

180
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:05,945
Her hand's in the air,
like, every five seconds,

181
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:08,823
and she actually reminded
Mr. Waters to assign homework.

182
00:08:08,907 --> 00:08:11,409
The class loved that. Do you
know how embarrassed I was?

183
00:08:11,493 --> 00:08:14,663
Not as embarrassed as I was when
she said eight was a prime number.

184
00:08:14,746 --> 00:08:15,789
Eight, Mom.

185
00:08:15,872 --> 00:08:17,332
Okay, fine.
You know what?

186
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:19,918
I'm gonna call the school today
and have your schedules changed.

187
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:23,588
But I want you to know, a little
part of me died today, okay?

188
00:08:23,713 --> 00:08:27,926
I thought the two of you could understand how
being in the same class would benefit you both.

189
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:30,095
Alex, you-you could've
tutored Haley.

190
00:08:30,178 --> 00:08:33,014
Haley, you could've helped Alex
with her social skills.

191
00:08:33,098 --> 00:08:36,726
Come on. The two of you could've
been two super-Dunphys.

192
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:38,353
And instead, what are you?

193
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:41,773
Two bickering half-Dunphys, and
I'm the fool that expected more.

194
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:43,108
You know what-
How do you ever-

195
00:08:43,191 --> 00:08:47,153
I don't even want to hear it.
Just go upstairs. Go.

196
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:51,241
Wow. What was that?

197
00:08:52,742 --> 00:08:54,703
That was a master class
in parenting.

198
00:08:54,786 --> 00:08:59,040
Right now, our daughters are upstairs,
making a decision they think is their own,

199
00:08:59,124 --> 00:09:01,876
but really it was an idea that
was skillfully implanted by me.

200
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,129
Inception Claire.

201
00:09:04,254 --> 00:09:06,798
Dangerous game, but I like it.
Mmm.

202
00:09:09,884 --> 00:09:11,136
What are those?

203
00:09:11,219 --> 00:09:13,471
Wire walkers.

204
00:09:13,555 --> 00:09:16,725
You want to go to the dance,
you gotta wear the shoes.

205
00:09:16,808 --> 00:09:18,309
Luke, grab your camera.

206
00:09:20,353 --> 00:09:21,354
Luke!

207
00:09:21,438 --> 00:09:23,064
I wasn't sleeping!

208
00:09:24,858 --> 00:09:28,611
Honey, I-l think
those are jazz shoes.

209
00:09:28,695 --> 00:09:30,196
Nope.
Tightrope shoes.

210
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,741
Got 'em at an estate sale.
Only worn once.

211
00:09:32,824 --> 00:09:34,242
That is not
a ringing endorsement-

212
00:09:34,367 --> 00:09:35,493
Oh!

213
00:09:35,577 --> 00:09:40,707
Phil, honey- Please be...
careful, all right?

214
00:09:40,832 --> 00:09:43,084
Watch the door.

215
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,755
Hey, what'd you get
for number three?

216
00:09:46,838 --> 00:09:49,132
You're not going to learn
if I just give you answers.

217
00:09:49,215 --> 00:09:51,718
Well, what if I gave you
something in return?

218
00:09:51,801 --> 00:09:52,844
Like what?

219
00:09:53,678 --> 00:09:54,929
You can talk to me
in class.

220
00:09:58,767 --> 00:10:00,935
I want lunch at the cool table.

221
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:03,772
- Then I want all the answers.
- Then I want a week at the table.

222
00:10:03,855 --> 00:10:05,607
- That'll cost you two pop quizzes.
- A month.

223
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,192
- The midterm.
- Deal.

224
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:10,069
Lookin' great, Dad.

225
00:10:10,153 --> 00:10:14,866
With these steps,
I break the surly bonds-

226
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:16,576
Chicken in a basket!

227
00:10:19,204 --> 00:10:21,289
Don't look at me.

228
00:10:21,414 --> 00:10:23,416
Mom? Mom!
What? What, what, what?

229
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,293
Mom, did you
call the school yet?

230
00:10:25,376 --> 00:10:27,295
Uh, not yet,
but I was just about to.

231
00:10:27,378 --> 00:10:29,088
Ah, Bartles and Jaymes!

232
00:10:29,214 --> 00:10:31,591
Good. Because we were thinking we
might want to stay in that class.

233
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:33,718
Really? Oh, girls,
I don't know about that.

234
00:10:33,802 --> 00:10:36,346
- Oh, please let us try it.
- Super-Dunphy.

235
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:39,265
I can't hold her.
I can't hold her!

236
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:42,352
Well, maybe one more week.

237
00:10:43,228 --> 00:10:44,854
Thanks, Mom.

238
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:51,736
I don't know.
A cup of soup, a Cobb salad.

239
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,613
Yeah, it had bacon.

240
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:56,449
Hey, Cam, I don't have all day
to describe all my meals to you.

241
00:10:56,574 --> 00:11:01,204
Stop eating all
my things, you stupid animal.

242
00:11:01,287 --> 00:11:02,956
No, Cam, not you.
I'll call you back!

243
00:11:04,123 --> 00:11:05,291
Bad doggie!

244
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:09,128
You want to chew on something?
Okay, okay, okay.

245
00:11:09,212 --> 00:11:13,132
Look at this. Look at
this delicious man shoe.

246
00:11:13,216 --> 00:11:16,886
Eat it. Come on.
Eat it. Eat it!

247
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,805
Mmm. Yummy.

248
00:11:18,888 --> 00:11:21,766
Eat the shoe!

249
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,768
Eat his shoe.
Come on. Eat his shoe.

250
00:11:23,852 --> 00:11:25,979
Yum, yum, Wm, Wm-
Yum, yum, Wm, Wm-

251
00:11:26,062 --> 00:11:28,189
Yeah. Like this, look.

252
00:11:28,314 --> 00:11:29,732
Delicious!

253
00:11:29,816 --> 00:11:32,402
Mom?

254
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:35,238
Drop it.

255
00:11:38,992 --> 00:11:41,744
- I w-
- Please. I'm sorry you had to see this.

256
00:11:48,376 --> 00:11:50,503
Hello.

257
00:11:50,587 --> 00:11:52,839
Hi, Mrs. Dunphy. This is
Rose from the principal's office.

258
00:11:52,922 --> 00:11:55,800
Could you hold for Principal Weller?
Yes.

259
00:11:55,884 --> 00:11:57,385
No, no, no, no.

260
00:11:57,468 --> 00:11:59,137
Hi, Claire.
Hi, John.

261
00:11:59,262 --> 00:12:00,930
What'd she do this time?

262
00:12:01,014 --> 00:12:03,224
Actually,
I've go! both of them in here.

263
00:12:03,308 --> 00:12:05,351
Both of them?
Really?

264
00:12:05,435 --> 00:12:07,645
Alex was letting Haley
copy her home Work.

265
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:10,565
Mr. Waters caught them.
I-l don't believe it.

266
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:14,152
I'm about to have a little talk with them,
so the they'll be out a few minutes late.

267
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:15,987
Uh, I'm so sorry, John.

268
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,490
And honestly, I-I really am a
better mother than this, I promise.

269
00:12:19,574 --> 00:12:22,118
So you've said.
Mm-hmm.

270
00:12:23,828 --> 00:12:24,829
Seriously?

271
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:29,375
Seriously? Oh!

272
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:33,421
Excuse me.
Hey, um, what the hell is this?

273
00:12:33,504 --> 00:12:36,591
This zone is for loading and unloading,
not for talking on the phone.

274
00:12:36,674 --> 00:12:38,509
Yeah, I know, but
I was talking on the phone...

275
00:12:38,593 --> 00:12:40,845
to the school that my kids
are about to come out of, so-

276
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:43,389
Are you aware this zone
has a time limit?

277
00:12:43,473 --> 00:12:44,807
N-No, I'm not.

278
00:12:44,891 --> 00:12:46,351
Wow.

279
00:12:48,186 --> 00:12:49,979
You know what?
I do want to do some unloading.

280
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,440
I know your type.

281
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:56,277
Life has been bad to you.
It has made you feel small.

282
00:12:56,361 --> 00:12:59,739
And then one day, somebody
gives you a fake cop outfit,

283
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:01,950
a toy badge
and a little SpongeBob tie.

284
00:13:02,033 --> 00:13:03,993
Suddenly it's payback time,
right?

285
00:13:04,077 --> 00:13:08,373
Well, I got news for you, Law and
Special Parking Unit.

286
00:13:09,374 --> 00:13:11,209
It's not my fault.

287
00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:21,719
I'm really sorry, Dad. Oh, it's all right.
Everybody throws up at school.

288
00:13:21,803 --> 00:13:25,056
If I had a nickel for every time I puked at
school, you know how much money I'd have?

289
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:26,641
Thirty-five cents?

290
00:13:26,724 --> 00:13:29,936
Exactly. Now, go get cleaned
up, and I'll call the doctor.

291
00:13:30,061 --> 00:13:33,106
Wait, Dad. I don't need a doctor.
What's up?

292
00:13:33,189 --> 00:13:36,484
The other day, Uncle Mitchell
brought over a bag of junk food...

293
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:38,486
so he and Cam could do
a Jew fast.

294
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:39,821
Juice fast?

295
00:13:39,904 --> 00:13:41,489
I'm pretty sure
he said Jew.

296
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:45,201
But anyway, I took the bag,
and I hid it, and I ate it all.

297
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:47,912
Oh, buddy.
I couldn't help myself.

298
00:13:47,996 --> 00:13:50,331
I'm weak.
Don't look at me.

299
00:13:50,415 --> 00:13:52,834
It's all right.
it's okay.

300
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:57,588
Hey, you learned a lesson. A painful lesson.

301
00:13:59,215 --> 00:14:03,052
I guess we both have.
What do you mean?

302
00:14:03,136 --> 00:14:06,472
I always saw myself as a guy who could
soar through the sky, dancing on a wire.

303
00:14:06,556 --> 00:14:09,767
I can't even get across one
six inches off the ground.

304
00:14:09,851 --> 00:14:12,687
Well,
maybe that's the problem.

305
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:17,191
Maybe you keep falling because part
of you knows that you can fall.

306
00:14:17,275 --> 00:14:20,611
Maybe if the wire was much,
much higher, you wouldn't fall.

307
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:24,365
Oh, Luke, Luke, Luke.

308
00:14:25,491 --> 00:14:27,994
You are a genius.
Come on. We got work to do!

309
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:31,497
Yes! Can I have a doughnut first?
Yes, you can!

310
00:14:31,581 --> 00:14:34,500
Ah, there they are.

311
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,919
My Super-Dunphys.
We're sorry, but we just-

312
00:14:37,003 --> 00:14:39,964
Ah, ah, ah.
You don't get to talk!

313
00:14:40,048 --> 00:14:42,925
You had a chance
to be better people today.

314
00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:46,763
You, to be more well-rounded,
and you, to be a better student.

315
00:14:46,846 --> 00:14:50,892
You could have elevated the Dunphy name,
but instead you chose to tarnish it.

316
00:14:50,975 --> 00:14:52,935
So congratulations, ladies.

317
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:54,645
You brought this family
to a new low.

318
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:57,899
Mom, are you-

319
00:14:57,982 --> 00:14:59,567
Yeah.
Yeah, I am.

320
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,028
And I would actually like to get
these loosened up, if I might.

321
00:15:02,111 --> 00:15:03,780
Are we gonna have
any more trouble?

322
00:15:03,863 --> 00:15:04,906
No, ma'am.

323
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:06,699
Claire, do you
need me to drive the girls?

324
00:15:06,783 --> 00:15:08,785
All good, Janet.
Real good.

325
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,413
Goat cheese
risotto ball?

326
00:15:12,497 --> 00:15:13,956
No, thank you.

327
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,167
Are you sure?
They're so good.

328
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,752
Walk away.

329
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:20,088
It's tough enough to deal with
Cam when I'm at full strength.

330
00:15:20,171 --> 00:15:22,507
But I have been fasting
just as long as he has,

331
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,092
and I do not have
the energy...

332
00:15:24,175 --> 00:15:26,219
to deal with
a big, needy brisket case-

333
00:15:26,302 --> 00:15:29,097
Bras- Basket case.

334
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,601
Cam! Don't be mad at me, but I think
that you really need to eat something.

335
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:36,562
What? You're supposed to
be my support.

336
00:15:36,646 --> 00:15:37,939
Oh, away from me, temptress.

337
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:40,399
And I never thought I would
call you that in a negative way.

338
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:43,152
I've seen her do
a lot of crazy stuff,

339
00:15:43,236 --> 00:15:45,363
but this
is a whole new level.

340
00:15:46,364 --> 00:15:48,324
- Is this a people cookie?
- You're good.

341
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:50,243
A definitive yes or no
would be appreciated.

342
00:15:50,326 --> 00:15:51,828
Those cupcakes
did a number on me.

343
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:57,333
Are you happy?

344
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,794
You have reduced me
to a person who eats a shoe.

345
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:00,878
Gloria, sit.

346
00:16:00,962 --> 00:16:02,296
Do you think this is funny,

347
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,923
to talk to me like I am a dog?

348
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:05,508
I'm not talking to you
like you're a dog.

349
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:08,177
I'm just asking you to sit, so we
can get to the bottom of this.

350
00:16:08,261 --> 00:16:10,138
Okay, fine.

351
00:16:10,221 --> 00:16:11,514
Good girl.

352
00:16:12,223 --> 00:16:13,307
Come on. You set me up.

353
00:16:13,391 --> 00:16:15,017
Gloria, why are you
acting so crazy?

354
00:16:15,101 --> 00:16:16,602
It's just a little dog.

355
00:16:16,686 --> 00:16:18,479
It's not the little dog
that is making me crazy.

356
00:16:18,563 --> 00:16:19,856
It's you that
is making me crazy!

357
00:16:19,981 --> 00:16:21,482
Me?
Yeah.

358
00:16:21,566 --> 00:16:24,235
You used to put me first! You
used to want me in that shower!

359
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:25,736
Should I be here for this?

360
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,405
No, Manny, it's okay.
I go.

361
00:16:27,488 --> 00:16:30,783
But I want you to know this. Where
I come from, man cherish woman.

362
00:16:30,867 --> 00:16:34,745
It goes wife, mistress, dog.
Dog always at the bottom!

363
00:16:37,248 --> 00:16:39,333
As you can imagine,
I get asked to help, uh,

364
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:41,210
with a lot of these
environmental causes.

365
00:16:41,294 --> 00:16:45,715
Usually, I buy a ticket, bid on
Shaquille O'Neal's big shoe-

366
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,010
and, uh, come home.

367
00:16:49,093 --> 00:16:52,346
But then, something happened.

368
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:55,266
Um, I love paddle surfing.

369
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:59,103
And each time I'd go out,
I'd see this one sea lion.

370
00:16:59,187 --> 00:17:00,771
He'd pop his head up,
he'd check me out.

371
00:17:00,855 --> 00:17:04,150
I got so used to seein' him,
I even named him- Snorkels.

372
00:17:04,275 --> 00:17:06,861
God, I do not like where this is going.

373
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:10,239
So one day, I, uh, I go
out, and I see Snorkels.

374
00:17:10,323 --> 00:17:13,201
But he's doin' this weird
twisting thing in the water.

375
00:17:13,284 --> 00:17:16,204
- Oh, God. Oh, God, oh, God.
- Shh. Shh.

376
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:20,583
So I paddle over, and I see he's
got a plastic grocery bag...

377
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,628
wrapped around his neck
and one of his fins.

378
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:27,298
And I freaked. Tried to get
it off with my paddle.

379
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:29,675
Didn't work,
so I jumped in,

380
00:17:31,302 --> 00:17:34,096
but he disappeared
under the water, and, uh-

381
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,515
Don't say it.
Don't you dare say it.

382
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:38,643
And I never saw him again.

383
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:42,230
Oh. This is the saddest
thing I've ever-

384
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,735
Mitchell, are you okay?

385
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:51,239
No, of course I'm not okay.
None of this is okay.

386
00:17:51,322 --> 00:17:53,658
Okay. You need to pull yourself together,
'cause we're at your boss's house.

387
00:17:53,741 --> 00:17:56,410
He drowned, Cam!

388
00:17:56,494 --> 00:17:58,037
Okay.

389
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,082
- Is he all right?
- Yeah, yeah. I think he just needs a little air.

390
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:04,669
You know who else needed air?
Snorkels!

391
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,171
Excuse me.

392
00:18:07,255 --> 00:18:11,259
Snorkels!
Where are you, Snorkels?

393
00:18:11,342 --> 00:18:12,885
Mitchell, get back here!

394
00:18:12,969 --> 00:18:14,679
Oh, Snorkels.

395
00:18:14,762 --> 00:18:16,305
Mitchell,
what is wrong with you?

396
00:18:16,389 --> 00:18:18,766
What do you think is wrong with me?
I'm starving!

397
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:21,769
Well, if you're starving,
then just eat something!

398
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:24,981
I can't eat something, because
then you'll get mad at me,

399
00:18:25,064 --> 00:18:26,732
and we're at
my boss's house.

400
00:18:26,816 --> 00:18:28,651
I'm not gonna get mad at you!

401
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:32,571
I appreciate what you're doing for me.
I'm doing it for you.

402
00:18:32,655 --> 00:18:35,449
Oh, you don't have to do anything for me.
I love you just the way you are.

403
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:37,618
I love you
just the way you are.

404
00:18:40,705 --> 00:18:42,290
Whoa!

405
00:18:42,415 --> 00:18:44,208
Okay.  I got you!
I got you!

406
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,043
Thank you.
I got you! I got you!

407
00:18:47,378 --> 00:18:49,380
I got you! I can walk.
I can walk.

408
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:53,718
I think Mitchell may just be
a work friend.

409
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:00,558
I letdown
my mom and dad today-

410
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,311
Worse than that,

411
00:19:03,394 --> 00:19:05,146
I let down my teacher.

412
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:08,524
It's all my fault. Everything
I touch turns to detention.

413
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:11,319
I'm sorry, Mom.
Me too.

414
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:15,698
I don't really have a whole lot
of moral high ground to stand on.

415
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:19,118
I wasn't exactly my
best self today either.

416
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:22,204
All in all, not a great
day for the Dunphys.

417
00:19:23,331 --> 00:19:25,624
Come on, Dad!
Believe in yourself!

418
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:29,170
You're making the impossible unimpossible.

419
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:31,339
Phil. Oh, my God.

420
00:19:31,422 --> 00:19:34,884
Don't even bother. He's in the zone.
He can't hear you.

421
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:37,345
Go, Dad!
You got this!

422
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:42,016
All Week long, I've been
telling my girls how to act...

423
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:43,601
instead of showing them.

424
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:45,811
But not Phil.

425
00:19:45,895 --> 00:19:50,024
Phil could have said, "Alex, relax.
Don't take everything so seriously." ...

426
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:53,611
Or "Haley, challenge yourself
Don't give up so easily."

427
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:57,323
But instead of talking the talk,
Phil Walked the Walk.

428
00:19:58,824 --> 00:20:01,035
And isn't that what we're supposed
to do for the people We love ?

429
00:20:06,624 --> 00:20:08,793
It's definitely a challenge.

430
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:12,713
Right, two, three.
And left, two-

431
00:20:12,797 --> 00:20:16,717
But Phil made it look easy
seven feet off the ground.

432
00:20:16,801 --> 00:20:17,885
Oh!

433
00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:22,139
- You're awesome!
- Oh, my goodness.

434
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:25,935
Turns out I've had
my Super Dunphy all along.

435
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:27,561
Yeah!

436
00:20:27,645 --> 00:20:30,022
Ohh!

437
00:20:30,106 --> 00:20:33,734
What was on my mind as I was
walking across that wire?

438
00:20:33,818 --> 00:20:36,737
I kept thinking,
"If I can do this,

439
00:20:38,656 --> 00:20:41,117
then I've got two ways
of getting across my yard."

440
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:46,038
Did you have fun?
Yes.

441
00:20:46,122 --> 00:20:48,707
She's the cutest doggie
in the whole world.

442
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,251
Yeah, I heard you
the first time.

443
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:51,836
Let's go find
your daddies.

444
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,421
We're in here.

445
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,924
Oh, my God. These
cupcakes are so good.

446
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:59,176
I'm so sorry we helped ourselves.
We were so hungry.

447
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,344
They are delicious.

448
00:21:00,428 --> 00:21:02,430
I love that they're not
too sweet, you know?

449
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:06,392
Mmm. They taste almost
like pété. I mean-

450
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:08,144
But why are you eating?

451
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:09,728
Well- Been on a juice cleanse.

452
00:21:09,854 --> 00:21:12,356
You need to mind your own
business, sweetie, for now. Yeah.

453
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,859
Mmm.

454
00:21:20,448 --> 00:21:21,449
