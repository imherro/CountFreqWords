1
00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:06,884
Ooh! Individual frittatas.
What a treat.

2
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:08,969
You're a lucky man, Phil.
I'm always saying, I'm-

3
00:00:09,094 --> 00:00:10,554
Phil. Sorry.

4
00:00:10,637 --> 00:00:12,139
You left the milk
out again.

5
00:00:12,222 --> 00:00:14,183
Mmm. I may have to take
one of these little guys home.

6
00:00:14,266 --> 00:00:15,976
Claire, did you ever find
that Tupperware I lent you?

7
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,730
Sweetie, for the hundredth time,
I gave it back to you. Remember?

8
00:00:19,813 --> 00:00:23,567
I remember you telling me a hundred
times, yet my pea soup is in Baggies.

9
00:00:23,692 --> 00:00:26,153
Did you check your car,
in the, um- Trunk.

10
00:00:26,236 --> 00:00:27,946
Because that's where
you found that thing...

11
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,781
that you thought that you
gave me long time ago.

12
00:00:29,907 --> 00:00:31,533
The-The-
Pizza cutter.

13
00:00:31,617 --> 00:00:33,869
- Good. Give me another one.
- Yes, I was wrong that time.

14
00:00:33,952 --> 00:00:36,371
It's a piece of plastic.
You're ruining brunch.

15
00:00:36,455 --> 00:00:38,582
Don't sweat it, Cam.
I forget things all the time.

16
00:00:38,665 --> 00:00:40,709
Like I can never
remember the name...

17
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:42,669
of that weather guy
that I liked.

18
00:00:42,753 --> 00:00:45,047
Uh, Thunder-something.
Stormy-

19
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,090
Flash Storm? Ah!
Whatever the hell it is.

20
00:00:47,216 --> 00:00:49,509
I don't know.
Just eat your eggs, Jay.

21
00:00:49,593 --> 00:00:51,303
Yeah. Just eat
your eggs, Jay.

22
00:00:51,386 --> 00:00:53,722
Ay! Qué linda!

23
00:00:53,805 --> 00:00:56,141
Grandpa got told!

24
00:00:56,225 --> 00:00:59,645
Look at them.
They all think Lily's so great.

25
00:00:59,728 --> 00:01:00,938
The novelty will wear off.

26
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:02,689
We used to be
the cute ones.

27
00:01:02,773 --> 00:01:04,399
Now she gets
all the attention.

28
00:01:04,483 --> 00:01:06,401
We need to take her down.

29
00:01:06,485 --> 00:01:07,986
I should remember
his name, too,

30
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,447
because your mom and I
got in a big fight over him.

31
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,824
She was using the convertible,
and I told her,

32
00:01:12,908 --> 00:01:15,661
"Put the top up because it's
supposed to rain tonight...

33
00:01:15,744 --> 00:01:17,704
according to"-

34
00:01:17,788 --> 00:01:20,749
P-P-P- Partly McCloudy-
whatever the hell his name is.

35
00:01:20,832 --> 00:01:23,126
Anyway, she didn't.
Ruined the car.

36
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:26,088
Well, not to be the one that
always comes to Mom's defense-

37
00:01:26,171 --> 00:01:27,965
What? It was 20 years ago.

38
00:01:28,048 --> 00:01:29,758
What, you think
he's gonna ground you?

39
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:31,593
- It was you?
- Yes.

40
00:01:31,677 --> 00:01:34,763
Yes, I left the top down,
and I let Mom take the fall.

41
00:01:34,846 --> 00:01:36,932
- And then they got divorced.
- Twelve years later.

42
00:01:37,015 --> 00:01:38,725
- I'm just saying.
- Oh! You're ruining brunch.

43
00:01:38,809 --> 00:01:42,062
Relax. It was years ago. There's a
statute of limitation on this stuff.

44
00:01:42,145 --> 00:01:43,855
In that case, I should
probably let you know...

45
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:46,608
I let the top down to let out
the cigarette smoke.

46
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:50,487
Not mine. Not mine.
My bad friend- Eleanor.

47
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,197
"Eleanor" being
her boyfriend, Allan.

48
00:01:52,322 --> 00:01:55,033
Statute of limitations.  Relax.
it's okay.

49
00:01:55,117 --> 00:01:58,704
Remember when I told you that I couldn't
get to your figure skating semifinal...

50
00:01:58,787 --> 00:02:00,414
- because I was stuck at work?
- Yeah.

51
00:02:00,497 --> 00:02:02,207
Well, by "stuck,"
I meant drunk.

52
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,001
And by "work,"
I meant the golf course.

53
00:02:04,084 --> 00:02:05,585
Jay!

54
00:02:05,669 --> 00:02:07,879
- Oh, Dad.
- Oh, no. I got one. I got one.

55
00:02:07,963 --> 00:02:09,631
Remember that time we
went golfing together,

56
00:02:09,756 --> 00:02:11,466
and you got a hole in one? Yeah?

57
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,135
You never got
a hole in one.

58
00:02:13,218 --> 00:02:15,304
I got bored,
and I kicked it in the hole.

59
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,724
This is fun.
Here's a corker.

60
00:02:18,807 --> 00:02:21,351
They didn't used to label babies
as carefully in hospitals.

61
00:02:21,435 --> 00:02:23,103
- So for two days-
- Not now, Phil!

62
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:24,938
What do you mean,
you kicked the ball in the hole?

63
00:02:25,063 --> 00:02:28,567
What, was it on the edge? Yeah. It was on
the edge of that, uh- that sandy thing.

64
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,986
Gee, it's sure gonna be fun
to face my friends today.

65
00:02:31,111 --> 00:02:33,947
You don't have to tell them.
They call me Ace, Mitch.

66
00:02:34,031 --> 00:02:36,616
I haven't paid for lemonade
down there in 20 years.

67
00:02:36,742 --> 00:02:38,785
You're mad at me?  Mmm.

68
00:02:40,203 --> 00:02:42,289
Great, Daddy.
You ruined brunch.

69
00:02:42,414 --> 00:02:44,291
Ay! Qué linda!

70
00:02:44,374 --> 00:02:45,917
You did.

71
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:47,836
This ends today.

72
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,671
Is that what
you're calling them?

73
00:02:50,589 --> 00:02:52,507
# Hey, hey #

74
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:54,426
# Hey, hey #

75
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:56,595
# Hey, hey #

76
00:02:56,678 --> 00:02:58,513
# Hey, hey #

77
00:02:58,597 --> 00:02:59,765
# Hey ##

78
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:04,019
A little help here.

79
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:05,562
You can't expect me to focus...

80
00:03:05,645 --> 00:03:07,189
when Miranda Cornell lives
right down your street.

81
00:03:07,272 --> 00:03:08,982
She's like a dream
wrapped in a wish...

82
00:03:09,066 --> 00:03:10,776
poured into jeggings.

83
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:13,862
Yeah, yeah. That's nice and all,
but we got a trap to set.

84
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:15,530
Are you sure
this is going to work?

85
00:03:15,614 --> 00:03:18,283
Trust me. We'll use
these cookies as bait.

86
00:03:18,367 --> 00:03:20,035
Lily's crazy for them.

87
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:21,620
Asian metabolism.

88
00:03:21,703 --> 00:03:23,705
When she grabs one with
her grubby little hands,

89
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:25,415
off goes the trap.

90
00:03:25,499 --> 00:03:28,794
Boom- big puddle of milk.
She'll get in so much trouble.

91
00:03:28,877 --> 00:03:30,587
My mom hates messes.

92
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,547
I'm familiar with Claire.

93
00:03:32,631 --> 00:03:35,550
Lock ... and loaded.

94
00:03:36,468 --> 00:03:39,429
Mmm! These cookies
are so good...

95
00:03:39,513 --> 00:03:42,099
and so easy to reach.

96
00:03:42,182 --> 00:03:43,725
Lily!

97
00:03:50,524 --> 00:03:53,235
Oh!

98
00:03:56,238 --> 00:03:58,448
Oh, my God! Cam!

99
00:03:58,532 --> 00:04:00,200
What happened?
Are you okay?

100
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:03,912
That milk fell, and
I must have slipped in it.

101
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:06,331
Did I leave that out again?
I'm so sorry!

102
00:04:06,415 --> 00:04:07,999
Oh, my back.
Oh, my back.

103
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,836
Can I give you a Swedish
massage, accent optional?

104
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:13,171
Oh. Oh, no. I just
need to lie down.

105
00:04:13,255 --> 00:04:15,298
Come on. Let's get you
over to the sofa.

106
00:04:15,382 --> 00:04:17,592
Oh! Do you think it
would be offensive...

107
00:04:17,676 --> 00:04:19,428
if I ask our daughter
to walk on my back?

108
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:22,597
I'd say so. I just offered
to give you a massage.

109
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:25,392
Oh, no! You broke Beatrice.

110
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:27,853
Now she can't
feed the dolphins.

111
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:30,522
What is she talking about? Oh.
it's a My Sweet Companion doll.

112
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:32,441
They all have these
elaborate backstories.

113
00:04:32,524 --> 00:04:34,776
Beatrice works with
blind dolphins and models.

114
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,362
There are blind models?

115
00:04:37,446 --> 00:04:41,032
That's so sad. They cannot see
how pretty they are.

116
00:04:43,243 --> 00:04:45,787
Okay. Hold on. Give me some. Give me some.
Give me some.

117
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:47,414
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh!

118
00:04:47,497 --> 00:04:49,624
Let me buy Lily
a new doll.

119
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:51,960
It's my fault Cam fell.
No, no need.

120
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:55,505
The My Sweet Companion store actually
has a hospital with an on-call doctor.

121
00:04:55,589 --> 00:04:57,799
I can go. I'm taking the
girls to the mall anyway.

122
00:04:57,883 --> 00:05:00,302
Oh, that'd be great. Yeah. And don't worry.
She has medical insurance.

123
00:05:00,385 --> 00:05:02,429
And I think we've met our
deductible for the year.

124
00:05:02,554 --> 00:05:04,473
- So you should be good.
- Yeah.

125
00:05:04,556 --> 00:05:06,183
Do you know what a doll
is in my village?

126
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:08,059
An apple on a fork.

127
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:14,441
I never really got dolls.
Does that make me weird?

128
00:05:14,566 --> 00:05:16,276
it's on the list.
You're not weird.

129
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:18,403
You just kind of skipped
the "little girl" stage.

130
00:05:18,487 --> 00:05:21,239
And jumped to the "I dare you
to ring her doorbell" stage.

131
00:05:21,323 --> 00:05:23,783
The only stage you're ever going
to jump on has a pole on it.

132
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:25,619
Hey, at least I have
the body- Oh, please!

133
00:05:25,702 --> 00:05:30,499
Okay, okay! We're gonna have to settle
this dispute in court- the food court.

134
00:05:30,582 --> 00:05:33,168
The Honorable Judge
Cinnabon presiding.

135
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:36,546
The food court? That place smells like
the inside of Luke's bicycle helmet.

136
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,673
I like the food court. Me too.

137
00:05:38,757 --> 00:05:40,675
Don't worry, girls. We're not
gonna deprive ourselves...

138
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,260
just 'cause
Haley's aversion-

139
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:47,474
Oh. Oh. Haley's aversion.

140
00:05:47,557 --> 00:05:50,769
I thought you said-
Never mind.

141
00:05:58,777 --> 00:06:02,781
Okay. So after you have turned on the
monitor and selected your input,

142
00:06:02,864 --> 00:06:04,991
you can change the channel
with this guy.

143
00:06:05,116 --> 00:06:07,661
But if you need to change
the volume- You know what?

144
00:06:07,744 --> 00:06:09,454
I think I'm fine. Why
don't you just go ahead?

145
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:11,039
I know this sounds
really confusing,

146
00:06:11,122 --> 00:06:12,916
but there's actually a very
simple way to remember it.

147
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:15,835
# Input one is the cable box #

148
00:06:15,961 --> 00:06:18,505
# Cable box, cable box- ##
I think I'm just gonna take a nap.

149
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:22,676
Okay. I'm goin' to yoga.
That sounds like so much fun.

150
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:25,262
- You should go with her, Gloria. -We
should definitely do that sometime.

151
00:06:25,387 --> 00:06:27,597
I would love it. Bye.

152
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:30,475
Do you see how she gives me
the cold shoulders?

153
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,686
I don't even know why I try.

154
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:35,355
Oh, well, that's just Claire.
You know? She's a Pritchett.

155
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,732
You gotta break
through those walls.

156
00:06:37,816 --> 00:06:40,610
- The sooner, the better.
- You really think so?

157
00:06:40,694 --> 00:06:43,655
Yeah. Why don't you go? Now.
Forge that friendship.

158
00:06:43,738 --> 00:06:46,616
Okay, I go. I have
my gym bag in the car.

159
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:48,577
Feel better!
Okay. Thank you.

160
00:06:48,702 --> 00:06:52,539
I'm just gonna lie here, some ice on my back.

161
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:03,883
I knew for a fact Claire
never returned my Tupperware.

162
00:07:03,967 --> 00:07:06,011
I just needed a few minutes
alone to find it.

163
00:07:06,094 --> 00:07:09,681
And when I did, I'd never have to
hear them snicker again.

164
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:12,225
"Oh, silly Cam."
Or "forgetful Cam."

165
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:15,604
Because revenge is a dish
best sewed cold.

166
00:07:15,687 --> 00:07:18,023
And even better two days later
out of a 24-ounce,

167
00:07:18,106 --> 00:07:21,026
microwave-friendly,
burp-sealed Pak-N-Stor.

168
00:07:32,037 --> 00:07:34,289
Oh, hey. I thought you were
going to the pharmacy.

169
00:07:34,414 --> 00:07:36,082
I forgot my phone.
Oh.

170
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:39,085
Oh! I think I'm just upset about
this stupid thing with my dad.

171
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:40,629
Sweetie, I'd love
to hear about it...

172
00:07:40,712 --> 00:07:42,547
when you come back with my
heating pad from the pharmacy.

173
00:07:42,631 --> 00:07:44,090
Because I hurt my back,
remember?

174
00:07:44,174 --> 00:07:46,760
I mean,
did he overreact or what?

175
00:07:46,843 --> 00:07:48,303
It's just a game, right?

176
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:50,555
Well, unless there's
something more to it.

177
00:07:51,473 --> 00:07:53,016
Maybe you should
go talk to him.

178
00:07:53,141 --> 00:07:55,143
Yeah.
Huh?

179
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:56,728
I should've just
kept my mouth shut.

180
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:58,396
I mean, it was
such a great day.

181
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,900
After he thought he got that hole
in one, he took us out to dinner.

182
00:08:02,025 --> 00:08:04,235
He bought me my first beer.
Well, there you go.

183
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,364
He's probably hurt because you marred
a very special father-son experience.

184
00:08:07,447 --> 00:08:09,199
- You think?
- You marred it.

185
00:08:09,282 --> 00:08:10,950
But you can fix it.

186
00:08:11,034 --> 00:08:13,119
He's down at the club
right now.

187
00:08:13,203 --> 00:08:16,039
Go, Mitchell!
Un-mar that memory!

188
00:08:16,122 --> 00:08:17,874
You know what?
I'm gonna do it.

189
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:19,167
Ow.
Sorry.

190
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,710
Don't worry.
I'll be back soon.

191
00:08:20,794 --> 00:08:23,088
Okay. I'll miss you.
Call first.

192
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,889
What were you thinking,
saying that in front of him?

193
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:34,432
I'm sorry.
It slipped out.

194
00:08:34,516 --> 00:08:36,351
Besides, I figured he knew.
Mom knows.

195
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:38,395
Only because she
dragged it out of Dylan.

196
00:08:38,478 --> 00:08:41,356
And she promised not to tell
dad until I left for college,

197
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:44,693
which means he might
have never found out.

198
00:08:44,776 --> 00:08:47,696
Stop panicking. We don't even know
for sure he heard what I said.

199
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:49,531
Okay. Beatrice
is with the nurse.

200
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:51,366
They'll call us.
Shouldn't be too long.

201
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:54,828
We can just wait until she's
married- Until she's... ready.

202
00:08:54,911 --> 00:08:56,871
Which, apparently,
everyone is these days.

203
00:08:56,955 --> 00:08:58,915
Funny, I used to think it'd be years
until everyone was ready,

204
00:08:58,998 --> 00:09:00,917
but I guess I was wrong-
wrong and naive.

205
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:06,840
Surprise!
Oh! Gloria!

206
00:09:06,923 --> 00:09:08,383
My God.

207
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:09,801
I came to do yoga
with you.

208
00:09:09,884 --> 00:09:11,386
Yeah, I wasn't expecting
to see you here.

209
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:13,138
A y, that's why
I say "Surprise!"

210
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:14,931
Yeah. This is awful,

211
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:17,517
because I was just thinking
I might have to bail on yoga.

212
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,394
I have the worst headache
all of a sudden.

213
00:09:19,477 --> 00:09:21,229
But yoga is good
for that, Claire.

214
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:23,356
For the meditation,
for the-

215
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,150
Yeah, yeah.
it's just right now,

216
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:27,986
I wanna go lie down
in a dark room and breathe.

217
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:29,154
That sounds like yoga.

218
00:09:29,237 --> 00:09:31,865
L- I realize that. Yes.

219
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:34,242
But still, I-l should go.
Come on.

220
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:36,411
I'm not gonna
do the class by myself.

221
00:09:36,494 --> 00:09:38,413
Okay, so let's go
and get massages.

222
00:09:38,496 --> 00:09:40,248
Or there's
a nail salon there.

223
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:42,375
I would love to do that some other time.
I really would.

224
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:44,794
But right now, I need to
get home and lie down.

225
00:09:44,878 --> 00:09:46,504
- You understand, right?
- Of course.

226
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:48,715
Okay.
You go!

227
00:09:50,383 --> 00:09:52,552
And lie.

228
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:56,765
You're better! Oh!
Barely. Barely, yeah.

229
00:09:56,848 --> 00:10:00,477
- I was just getting something cold for my back.
- Gravy?

230
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,812
Well, if it can save your mom's
turkey, it can save anything.

231
00:10:02,896 --> 00:10:04,606
I thought you were going
to see your friend Miranda.

232
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:06,441
This one chickened out.

233
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:08,276
For someone who says
he likes girls so much,

234
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:09,736
he sure is afraid of them.

235
00:10:09,861 --> 00:10:12,572
It's a dance, Luke.
Chicken dance.

236
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:15,950
Well, since you're back,
what if I give you 20 bucks...

237
00:10:16,034 --> 00:10:19,662
and YOU guys...
go wash my car?

238
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:23,750
Is that 20 bucks for each
of us or both of us?

239
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,126
Both.

240
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,961
That's what I thought.

241
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:38,056
Uh-oh, check it out. Ace is
drooling over his plaque again.

242
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:41,100
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't
smell you idiots come in.

243
00:10:41,184 --> 00:10:44,729
Listen, I've been thinking, maybe
it's time we retire the name "Ace."

244
00:10:44,813 --> 00:10:46,981
You mean the name you had
printed on your golf cap?

245
00:10:47,065 --> 00:10:48,775
- And his robe.
- You know, guys, about that-

246
00:10:48,858 --> 00:10:52,445
Remember how mad he got when I yanked
that cap off his head and put it on?

247
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:54,155
"You got to earn that!"

248
00:10:54,239 --> 00:10:56,991
I'm just glad one of those cheap
hair plugs didn't get caught in it.

249
00:10:57,075 --> 00:10:58,993
For the millionth time,
they're not plugs.

250
00:10:59,077 --> 00:11:00,954
So what, your hair just
came back when you turned 50?

251
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:03,456
Unlike your wife.
Hey, that was a blessing.

252
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,583
Otherwise, I wouldn't be taking
out Natalie Hobbs tonight.

253
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:07,418
Taking her out
or doing her taxes?

254
00:11:07,502 --> 00:11:11,840
I'm trying to find a way to come clean about
the hole in one, when it occurs to me-

255
00:11:11,923 --> 00:11:13,383
Why?

256
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:15,510
One idiot lies
about his sex life.

257
00:11:15,593 --> 00:11:19,347
The other dumbbell has a Ferrari
"in the shop" for years.

258
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,684
And moron number three
is a Hollywood stunt car driver...

259
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:26,229
who gets sick when he rides
backwards in the golf cart.

260
00:11:26,312 --> 00:11:28,857
So, you ladies ready
to tee off or what?

261
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,441
Just gotta
settle up our tab.

262
00:11:30,525 --> 00:11:32,694
- I took care of it.
- You said you were going to the restroom.

263
00:11:32,777 --> 00:11:34,821
Ah! Can't trust a word
out of this guy's mouth.

264
00:11:34,904 --> 00:11:36,573
Twenty years we've been
falling for this.

265
00:11:36,656 --> 00:11:39,701
I-I'm sorry to interrupt, but
my dad never lied to you guys.

266
00:11:39,826 --> 00:11:41,703
Mitchell. No, he didn't
even know until today...

267
00:11:41,828 --> 00:11:43,371
that he never made the hole in one.
Okay.

268
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:46,541
But the fact that he couldn't live
with himself when he found out...

269
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:48,501
and he raced down here
to confess to you,

270
00:11:48,585 --> 00:11:51,254
that just shows
the kind of man he is.

271
00:11:51,337 --> 00:11:54,048
He is a "hole in one"
kind of man.

272
00:11:54,132 --> 00:11:56,009
You never
got a hole in one?

273
00:11:56,092 --> 00:11:57,802
I didn't tell them.

274
00:11:59,012 --> 00:12:02,140
So this is the gang.
Introduce me.

275
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:07,687
Ah! Score!

276
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,898
It's not like me and Miranda
are perfectly suited.

277
00:12:09,981 --> 00:12:12,275
For one thing, she likes bad boys.
That's just not me.

278
00:12:12,358 --> 00:12:14,611
I'm gonna turn on some music.

279
00:12:14,736 --> 00:12:17,405
I'm sorry. I can't unlearn
how to treat a lady.

280
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:19,324
But where does that leave me-
waiting till I'm 40,

281
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:21,993
when she looks me up on Facebook
after her failed first marriage?

282
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:24,412
Okay.

283
00:12:24,537 --> 00:12:27,540
What are you doing? I'm sick of
hearing you whine about Miranda!

284
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:29,876
It's time to make her notice you!
But we can't!

285
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:32,086
We got a full tank of gas, and
she's right down the block.

286
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:33,922
Now buckle up.
Are you crazy?

287
00:12:34,005 --> 00:12:35,006
You tell me.

288
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:40,595
Whoo! Whoo!

289
00:12:40,678 --> 00:12:44,849
Whoo! Whoo!

290
00:12:49,437 --> 00:12:51,356
Lily, what is this?

291
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:54,776
Wouldn't you rather have a
chemistry set or some flash cards?

292
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:57,111
She's pretty.

293
00:12:57,195 --> 00:12:58,613
No. No, she's dirty.

294
00:12:58,696 --> 00:13:00,865
Look. Look at the dirt.

295
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:02,659
Let me wipe her off.

296
00:13:02,742 --> 00:13:05,328
Fix that.

297
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:07,664
Her braid's coming loose.
Come here.

298
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,751
Fix that right up.

299
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:16,339
So I've completed the examination.
She did really well.

300
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:17,548
What's the prognosis?

301
00:13:17,632 --> 00:13:19,717
We can fix
most of her arm,

302
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:23,513
but she'll never regain full
mobility in her shoulder joint,

303
00:13:23,596 --> 00:13:25,807
because they don't make
that part anymore.

304
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,308
Well, that's pretty good,
right?

305
00:13:27,392 --> 00:13:29,852
I mean, she'll look exactly the same.
No one will know.

306
00:13:29,936 --> 00:13:31,396
I'll know.

307
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:32,981
Uh-

308
00:13:33,064 --> 00:13:34,983
I'm just saying
I liked her the way she was.

309
00:13:35,066 --> 00:13:36,985
She was such
a sweet little doll.

310
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:40,029
I'm sorry, Doc. I'm having
trouble adjusting to all this.

311
00:13:40,113 --> 00:13:42,490
Uh, Dad, she's still
a sweet little doll.

312
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:44,784
No, she's broken.

313
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:46,786
No, she's just
changed a little.

314
00:13:46,911 --> 00:13:50,456
It happens. Dolls grow up.
Well, actually-

315
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,250
Uh, could you-
Yeah. Sure.

316
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:55,753
I actually have to go give a
little girl some pretty bad news.

317
00:13:59,382 --> 00:14:00,967
So, Haley.

318
00:14:03,678 --> 00:14:05,388
The thing is-

319
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:08,099
Fact- Haley's almost 18.

320
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:10,768
Fact- I am the cool dad.

321
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:15,231
Haley, I understand
that sex is a part of life.

322
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:18,026
I can't say that I'm thrilled to hear
this, but I'm sure you're being safe,

323
00:14:18,109 --> 00:14:20,987
and I hope that you'll feel free
to talk to me about this anytime.

324
00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:28,244
We should- We should probably get
Beatrice, like, a cast or something.

325
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:29,996
We can all sign it.

326
00:14:30,121 --> 00:14:32,665
Yeah?
Uh, yeah. Sure.

327
00:14:32,749 --> 00:14:35,460
Fact- I blew it.

328
00:14:37,086 --> 00:14:38,546
This repair's probably
gonna take a little while.

329
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:40,965
Why don't you run up to the
food court and grab us a table?

330
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,801
I'll get Alex and Lily.
Okay.

331
00:14:45,845 --> 00:14:47,805
Do you want the counter
or a booth?

332
00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:51,476
Whatever seems right to you.

333
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:56,022
I trust you.

334
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:01,319
I have a cool dad.

335
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:09,202
Okay. Your turn.
Uh-uh! No way!

336
00:15:09,285 --> 00:15:11,788
Do you want to get
her attention or not?

337
00:15:13,456 --> 00:15:15,833
# Yeah #

338
00:15:15,917 --> 00:15:17,251
# Ah! Ah! #

339
00:15:18,294 --> 00:15:19,837
# Uh! #

340
00:15:19,921 --> 00:15:22,548
# Yeah
Uh! Uh! Uh! #

341
00:15:22,632 --> 00:15:24,592
# Yeah #

342
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:28,679
# Uh let's- let's ride
Gotta hit the street #

343
00:15:28,763 --> 00:15:30,348
That was amazing!

344
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:32,391
Did you see the look
on Miranda's face?

345
00:15:32,475 --> 00:15:34,936
No. But you did good,
Thelma.

346
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:37,438
Please stop calling me that.
I hate that movie.

347
00:15:37,522 --> 00:15:39,565
What movie?

348
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,610
Uh-oh! Dead end.
You gotta make a U-ey.

349
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:45,238
I don't know
how to do that.

350
00:15:52,495 --> 00:15:54,956
# Ride, gotta hit the street
We pack the heat ##

351
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,791
She pretended
to have a headache, Cam.

352
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:58,668
She doesn't want
to spend time with me.

353
00:15:58,751 --> 00:16:00,711
Maybe she just wanted
to be alone.

354
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:02,296
Why?

355
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,383
Because some people really
value their privacy,

356
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:07,093
and you have
to respect that.

357
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,972
I have to go.

358
00:16:11,055 --> 00:16:13,057
Hola, Claire!

359
00:16:13,141 --> 00:16:15,268
Gloria, you've gotta
stop doing that!

360
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:18,229
Were you going back to the
yoga class without me?

361
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:20,314
No, that is not
why I came back.

362
00:16:20,398 --> 00:16:21,941
I don't understand you.

363
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:23,734
Why you don't want
to spend time with me?

364
00:16:23,818 --> 00:16:25,778
Everybody wants
to spend time with me.

365
00:16:25,862 --> 00:16:28,948
Even the lady that did my nails
wants to take me to Pilates.

366
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:30,992
I didn't come back here
to do yoga.

367
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:33,202
I don't do yoga.
it's a cover, okay?

368
00:16:33,286 --> 00:16:36,497
Look. I know that,
from the outside,

369
00:16:36,581 --> 00:16:38,499
it seems like I have
everything together.

370
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,835
No, not really.

371
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:42,920
My point is that my life
can be very stressful.

372
00:16:43,004 --> 00:16:45,923
And I have found a way
to cope with that stress.

373
00:16:46,007 --> 00:16:48,843
And it's my little secret,
and I'm not proud of it.

374
00:16:48,968 --> 00:16:51,345
Hey, Claire. See you inside.
Hey.

375
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:53,181
Is that what you do?

376
00:16:53,264 --> 00:16:55,683
No. No!

377
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:58,519
Okay. You're coming
with me. Come in.

378
00:16:58,603 --> 00:17:01,314
But listen to me, Gloria.

379
00:17:01,397 --> 00:17:03,316
It has to stay between us.

380
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:06,402
This is my sacred space.

381
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:13,534
It's just
such a great release.

382
00:17:13,618 --> 00:17:15,703
- Thank you for not judging me.
- Why would I?

383
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:17,455
If anything, it makes me
like you more.

384
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,165
Mmm. So, how often
do you come here?

385
00:17:19,248 --> 00:17:21,459
Not that often. No.

386
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:24,003
Hey. Maybe a little often.

387
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:25,171
That's so sad.

388
00:17:25,254 --> 00:17:26,964
I live with four teenagers.

389
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,425
You live with two adults.
You have no idea- No,no,no.

390
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:31,177
It's so sad that you
come here so often...

391
00:17:31,302 --> 00:17:33,554
and that's the best
that you can shoot. Oh!

392
00:17:35,306 --> 00:17:36,766
And that's
with pretty nails.

393
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:39,268
But improper stance. I- Okay.
Practice more.

394
00:17:39,352 --> 00:17:41,520
Here you go, Ace.

395
00:17:41,604 --> 00:17:43,564
I mean- What is
your real name?

396
00:17:43,648 --> 00:17:45,149
Jay.

397
00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:49,654
Dad, I- I told you,
forget about it.

398
00:17:49,737 --> 00:17:51,239
All right. Look.

399
00:17:51,322 --> 00:17:54,784
I just want you to know I
get why you're upset, okay?

400
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:57,203
That day you got the hole in
one, it meant a lot to you.

401
00:17:57,286 --> 00:18:01,082
And... l- I marred it.

402
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:03,251
But it meant a lot
to me too.

403
00:18:03,334 --> 00:18:04,794
We had a steak dinner,

404
00:18:04,877 --> 00:18:07,713
you gave me my first beer,
and,uh,

405
00:18:07,797 --> 00:18:10,299
it was one of the greatest days
we ever spent together.

406
00:18:10,383 --> 00:18:13,928
And it wasn't about some meaningless
hole in one. It was about us.

407
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:16,514
No. It was about
a hole in one.

408
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,432
Yes. Yes.
A-A little bit, maybe.

409
00:18:18,516 --> 00:18:21,060
But mostly, it was
about how we bonded.

410
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:24,522
I thought I hit a ball
straight from a tee...

411
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:27,692
really, really far
into a tiny hole.

412
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:29,986
Okay.

413
00:18:30,069 --> 00:18:32,029
God, when will I learn?

414
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:36,742
And it wasn't
your first beer anyway.

415
00:18:36,826 --> 00:18:39,078
Yes, it was, Dad, but I wouldn't
expect you to remember.

416
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:42,290
It was your 14th birthday.

417
00:18:42,373 --> 00:18:43,958
You asked me
for a sip of mine.

418
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,918
Your mom yelled at you
in front of all your friends,

419
00:18:46,002 --> 00:18:48,087
said you were
just a baby.

420
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,172
You ran outside in tears,

421
00:18:50,256 --> 00:18:53,467
which, unfortunately,
supported your mom's argument.

422
00:18:53,551 --> 00:18:56,637
Anyway, I came out
with a couple of beers.

423
00:18:56,721 --> 00:19:00,224
We drank 'em on the porch, watching
the storm clouds coming in.

424
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:06,188
I had completely forgotten
about that.

425
00:19:06,272 --> 00:19:08,357
You know, you're- you're unbelievable.
Just when I peg you as-

426
00:19:08,441 --> 00:19:09,900
Storm Stevens!
That's it!

427
00:19:09,984 --> 00:19:12,611
Give me something. I'm
gonna write it right here.

428
00:19:12,737 --> 00:19:15,364
Before I forget. "Storm
Stevens." Stevens.

429
00:19:17,158 --> 00:19:18,659
What were we just talking
about, just now?

430
00:19:18,743 --> 00:19:20,661
Oh.

431
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:22,288
No?
Mm-mmm.

432
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:25,124
Come on, Lily.
Let's see if Beatrice is ready.

433
00:19:30,588 --> 00:19:32,631
Hey, Dad.

434
00:19:32,715 --> 00:19:34,425
I know I'm way
too old for this,

435
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:36,510
but do you think
I could get this doll?

436
00:19:36,594 --> 00:19:39,013
Her name's Genevieve, and she's
developing a vaccine for-

437
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:42,308
Yes, you can get the doll. You can
get as many dolls as you want.

438
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,602
It's $200.

439
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:47,146
Or one is fine.

440
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:50,441
I know you're here.

441
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,113
Hello.

442
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:00,993
I have a bad
feeling about this.

443
00:20:01,077 --> 00:20:02,536
What if one of your
neighbors saw us?

444
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,288
Maybe we should
just confess.

445
00:20:04,372 --> 00:20:06,957
We will... in 20 years.

446
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,793
Huh?
You heard Grandpa.

447
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:10,586
There's a statute
of limitations,

448
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:13,756
which is a good thing, because
we still need to take Lily down.

449
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:15,549
Nah, let her be
the cute one.

450
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:18,677
We don't need that anymore.
We're bad boys now.

451
00:20:18,761 --> 00:20:22,723
Yeah. I like that.
Bad boys.

452
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:24,558
Your mom!

453
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:32,525
Oh, my God.

454
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:34,151
Cam!

455
00:20:34,235 --> 00:20:36,278
Um, this had a lid.

456
00:20:41,534 --> 00:20:43,369
I'll see you guys later.
I'm going to Abby's.

457
00:20:43,494 --> 00:20:47,331
Bye, honey. Have fun. Have fun, you.
With Abby.

458
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:50,167
We've confirmed
Abby's a real person and a female?

459
00:20:50,251 --> 00:20:52,586
Yes, sweetie. We met her.

460
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:55,297
Honey, we can't treat
Haley differently...

461
00:20:55,381 --> 00:20:57,675
just because we both know
what we know about her.

462
00:20:57,758 --> 00:21:00,261
I know. I just need time.

463
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:04,181
So Dylan told you?

464
00:21:04,265 --> 00:21:06,559
Why didn't he tell me? He and
I used to share everything.

465
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:08,894
You're upset
about a lot of things.

466
00:21:08,978 --> 00:21:12,231
Okay, I won't obsess over it.

467
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:15,067
I just wanna ask you one thing.
Hmm?

468
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:18,737
How long have you known?
Three months.

469
00:21:18,821 --> 00:21:22,408
So this giant thing
happened to our firstborn,

470
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:25,453
and you kept me in the dark
about it for three whole months?

471
00:21:25,536 --> 00:21:28,205
I'm sorry. I just wasn't sure
how you'd- Okay.

472
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:29,748
Thank you.
