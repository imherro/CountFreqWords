1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,467
So how's the family?
Great.

2
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:07,015
Kids are gettin' so big.
Haley's about to go off-

3
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:09,681
You can stop holding your stomach in.
to college.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,262
You still exercising?

5
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:12,892
Clearly.

6
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:14,689
I look at a Clint Eastwood
or a Chuck Norris ...

7
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:16,893
and I think, "There's no reason
I can't stay tough like"-

8
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,602
Oh, tickles.

9
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,235
But- Ow.

10
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,529
That hurt?
No. Not-

11
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,485
Ow.

12
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,112
Hmm.
What?

13
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,118
It's probably nothing.
You feeling okay?

14
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,038
Yeah. Maybe we'll just run a
couple of tests just to be safe.

15
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,957
What kind of tests? If there's
anything wrong, I'll give you a call.

16
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,630
Oh. Okay.

17
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,049
So, how's the real estate
market doing?

18
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,923
Well, interest rates are low,
so it's a great time to be a buyer,

19
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,004
but if you're a seller,
you really have to-

20
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,598
Bend over. True, but a
quality property is still-

21
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:51,302
No, no, no.
I need you to bend over.

22
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,012
On. Right.

23
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:57,271
Well, let's dim the lights, crank up the
Norah Jones and get this over with.

24
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:58,942
Okay.

25
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,437
Oh, hey, how'd it go?

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,739
Amazing.
I was so proud of him.

27
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:06,988
Oh, thanks, honey.
I'm kinda proud of me too.

28
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,569
Look at what they gave me.

29
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:11,121
"California State
Bar Association Award ...

30
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,369
for distinguished service in the
field of environmental law."

31
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,992
Wow.  You
should have seen it.

32
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,749
They called his name. He went up on stage.
He gave a great speech.

33
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:20,672
It was humble, inspirational,
with a touch of dry humor at the end.

34
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:23,008
It was very Colin Firth.
Oh, Cam.

35
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,838
Thank you, but it's hardly an Oscar.

36
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,424
In the environmental law community,
it kind of is an Oscar.

37
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,054
How was Lily?
I hope you weren't too bored.

38
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:33,602
Oh, please.
Are you kidding me?

39
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,896
I love talking to her.
She knows more words than Haley.

40
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:38,099
Oh, that looks great
up there.

41
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:41,230
How impressed are you
with your uncle right now?

42
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,108
So impressed.

43
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:46,281
I didn't want to ruin their moment by
telling them how many awards I've gotten,

44
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,781
but let's just say I don't get out
of bed for a trophy that size.

45
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,405
Darn it!

46
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,911
I'm trying to send an e-mail.
This mouse keeps sticking.

47
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,707
Pretty big reaction. it's]0 bucks, tops.

48
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:03,791
You just reminded me
about my dream last night.

49
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:06,798
I was in the middle of a meadow,
coming down a staircase.

50
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:10,632
Then suddenly
a black mouse showed up.

51
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:13,934
He stopped,
stared at me in the eyes ...

52
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,977
and opened his little mouth.

53
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,348
What'd it say?

54
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:22,560
What did he say, Jay? He was a mouse.
They don't know how to talk.

55
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:25,943
Now you're playing logic police? You're
standing on a staircase in a meadow?

56
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:30,117
In my country, when somebody
dreams about a black mouse,

57
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,986
it means that something bad is going to happen.
Ah, don't worry about it.

58
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,619
I dreamt about a lucky blue cow.
We're good to go.

59
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,995
Hey, Jay, this is what I'm
wearing for golfing tomorrow.

60
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,294
Wanted to give you a heads up
in case there's some overlap.

61
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:43,714
- What are you going for here?
- Matt Damon in Bagger Vance. You didn't get that?

62
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:46,417
I did. I think you
look just like him.

63
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,502
It's the whole reason
I asked you to teach me to golf.

64
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,553
Any sport where
you can wear this, I'm in.

65
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,600
Who is that?
It's]0:00 at night.

66
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,514
I'll get it.
Hold on, Gatsby.

67
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,346
Hola.
it's Javier. Open up!

68
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,931
Dad!

69
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,894
There's my campeén.

70
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,478
There's your black mouse.

71
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,689
Hola, Javier.
What are you doing in town?

72
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:11,742
I missed Manny's birthday.
Plus, I have a free week.

73
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:13,694
You're staying a week?
Make that go away.

74
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:16,371
So, Manny, tomorrow, in honor
of you becoming a man,

75
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:19,575
I am taking you to the racetrack
to enjoy the sport of kings.

76
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:21,160
That's so cool!

77
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:23,621
Actually, Manny and I have plans
to play golf tomorrow.

78
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,753
Golfing? Psht! That is for old men
and for women who like women.

79
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:29,210
Come on. Your dad is in town.
Let's go to the races.

80
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,215
- Yeah! Can we all go?
- Ay, no, baby, I can't.

81
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,843
I promised Haley that I was
gonna help her with her Spanish.

82
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,638
But Jay's going to go with you.
What?

83
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:40,347
I'm not gonna let Manny
take off with Javier by himself.

84
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:43,933
Once, when Manny was six,
Javier took him to the Petting Zoo,

85
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:48,316
which later I found out that was
the name of the stripper club.

86
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,649
A real petting zoo
would have been cleaner.

87
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,525
But I was looking forward to-
You're going.

88
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,610
That I don't miss.

89
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,155
# Hey, hey #

90
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,332
# Hey, hey #

91
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,284
# Hey, hey #

92
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,244
# Hey, hey #

93
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,749
# Hey ##

94
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,464
Would you look at that.

95
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:18,391
Oh. Yeah, you know, I never saw us
as "trophy on the mantel" people,

96
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:20,094
but yours looks
so gosh darn good up there,

97
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,179
I figured, why not be proud of
what we've done?

98
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,764
Yeah.

99
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:27,021
"First place,
bass-catcher spring fish-off.

100
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,228
Missouri North Division."

101
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,938
Two-day total
of 10 small-mouth bass ...

102
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,739
weighing 34.24 pounds,

103
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,942
with a four-and-a-half pound
kicker. Boom.

104
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,824
So you beat all the other boys
aged 12 through 17?

105
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,912
Mm-hmm. Sure did.
Wow.

106
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,535
Look at our trophies
up there.

107
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,492
We're a couple of winners,
aren't we?

108
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:46,086
Are we?

109
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:48,880
Claire?
Where are all my razor blades?

110
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,377
- They're not in that box?
- No.

111
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,551
- I guess they're gone.
- They can't be gone.

112
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:57,553
In my 20s, I went on a game show and
won a lifetime supply of razor blades.

113
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,475
Okay, Phil, time is up.
What is your answer?

114
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,805
3.14159.

115
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:07,141
Oh, I'm sorry, Phil.

116
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:11,195
The correct answer is "banana
cream." Banana cream.

117
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,613
Banana cream.
Well, you got me there, Chip.

118
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,281
But you're not leaving
empty-handed.

119
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:20,158
No, you're going home with a lifetime
supply of Genesis twin-blade razors.

120
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,990
What? Two blades in one razor?

121
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,167
Man, it'll never get better
than that!

122
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:30,039
You must have used 'em all up.
They said a lifetime supply.

123
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,624
Honey, you got 15 years
of free razor blades.

124
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,550
Put that in the "win" column
and move on.

125
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,971
Mom, is it okay
if my friend Walt comes over ...

126
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,514
to play Rebel Fighters 3?

127
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,182
Honey, don't you think
it's a little weird ...

128
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,518
that one of your best friends
is an 80-year-old man? No.

129
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,062
It makes it more fun
because he was in a real war.

130
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:49,687
He says cool things like,
"See ya in hell, Klaus."

131
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,269
I don't even
know what that means.

132
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:56,277
Oh, hey, Dad.
Some doctor called for you.

133
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,321
Dr. Sendroff?
Yeah, that's it.

134
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,863
You were in the shower.
What did he say?

135
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,867
He wants you to call him
right away.

136
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:05,199
Oh, well.
See ya in hell, Klaus.

137
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:06,955
What's wrong?

138
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,956
I don't know. He ran a few
tests on me yesterday.

139
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,709
He said he'd call if something
was wrong, and now he's calling.

140
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,415
Hi. This is Phil Dunphy.

141
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,047
I'm returning Dr. Sendroff's call.

142
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,252
Are you serious?

143
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,471
What?
He's on a flight to London.

144
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:23,892
Is there any way I can reach him or,
uh, someone else I can talk to?

145
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,094
Okay. Fine.

146
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,850
Please, just tell him it's urgent.

147
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,897
Thank you.

148
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,601
- Oh, boy.
- Honey, I'm sure it's nothing.

149
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,561
Claire, I'm tender under my arm.

150
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,488
Maybe Luke hit you with his broomstick
when you guys were playing quidditch.

151
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,737
I'm way too fast.
He never touched me.

152
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,614
I can assure you,
you are perfectly fine.

153
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:45,368
That's very comforting, coming from a
marketing major at a party school.

154
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:53,581
I
like the number four horse.

155
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,086
He loves this track.
His dad won the Preakness.

156
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,089
Last three finishes
were in the money.

157
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,011
I like Miranda's Miracle.
Why?

158
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,885
There's this girl, Miranda, in my
class, and she's really pretty.

159
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,433
And if she liked me back,
it'll be a miracle.

160
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,727
Would you bet two dollars
on that one for me, Jay?

161
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,814
Sure, but you're throwing your money away.
You both are.

162
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,644
The winner of the race will
be number seven, My Hometown.

163
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,603
Number seven.

164
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,781
Well, he's carrying three extra
pounds and he hates the distance.

165
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,529
Those are just words
on a page.

166
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,235
I look the horse in the eye,

167
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,284
and he tells me he is the winner.
Tells you, huh?

168
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:29,374
Perhaps this will sound crazy to
you- No need for the qualifier.

169
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,044
But I have always been able to
see into the soul of a horse.

170
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,588
It is a gift,
and I do not question it.

171
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:39,043
Just like I always end up on
the shortest line at the bank.

172
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,468
Maybe I should bet
on your horse.

173
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,966
Are you kidding me?
These aren't just words.

174
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,844
They give you
all this information ...

175
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,972
so you can make an informed
decision and beat the odds.

176
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:51,305
Yes, of course, and this is why
everybody with a racing form is rich.

177
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,311
Now come on.
It's time to place our bets.

178
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,892
What's it gonna be, Manny?

179
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,607
Two dollars on My Hometown. You
really think he's going to win?

180
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,567
Well, I only know what he
tells me with his eyes.

181
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,994
Don't ask me why,
but maybe in some previous life ...

182
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,537
I was a horse.

183
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,239
Or part of a horse.

184
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,586
Hey. Alex called. She left her cell phone here.
She's gonna come back and get it.

185
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:21,176
Cam, did you do something to
your fish trophy? Oh, yeah.

186
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,924
I forgot about
this fun middle part.

187
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,097
Now it looks like the fish
is jumping out of the water.

188
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,845
Yeah. Right over mine.

189
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,392
Do I sense something,
Mitchell?

190
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,765
You know, just because mine's
a little taller than yours ...

191
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,518
doesn't make yours
any less important.

192
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,724
Oh, no.
That's not what I was feeling.

193
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,980
Not even a little bit.

194
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,528
Oh, my God, you don't like
that I put my trophy up.

195
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,356
I just think it's a little weird that
immediately after I win a trophy,

196
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,195
you feel the need to dig this thing
up and plop it down next to mine.

197
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:50,656
I'll have you know that I've wanted
to display this for quite some time,

198
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:53,583
but I put it in a box in the garage
with all my other awards-

199
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,160
yes, awards-

200
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,998
out of courtesy
to a sadly award-less you.

201
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,878
It looks ridiculous.

202
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:05,554
Mine is a distinguished professional
award given to me by my peers,

203
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,131
and yours was
given to you on a pier.

204
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,889
Okay. For your information,
when I won this, it was a very big deal.

205
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,938
I cut a ribbon at the grocery store
and signed autographs.

206
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,812
"Best fishes, Cameron Tucker."

207
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,061
Oh, you know what?
I just remembered.

208
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,272
Mine comes with
a really fun pedestal too.

209
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:26,198
Ohh! Look at that.

210
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:29,115
Oh, and proper hierarchy is restored.
Mm-hmm.

211
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:32,994
Unless you suddenly remember
that your fish came with a top hat.

212
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,541
Okay. Well, you know what?

213
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,957
I'm going to go get Lily from her
party and go to the park. Okay.

214
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,709
This award has changed you,
Mitchell.

215
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,836
You may be flying high now,
but pretty soon ...

216
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,169
you're gonna be
free fallin', Tom Petty.

217
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,128
Because you're petty.

218
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,089
Tom Petty. Hmm? Get it?

219
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,888
About three sentences ago.

220
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,227
Hola, Haley.

221
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,804
Hi, Gloria.
Thanks for comin' over.

222
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,764
En espafiol, par favor.

223
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,566
Uh, hola, Gloria.

224
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,644
Gracias for comin' over.

225
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,229
No, the whole thing.

226
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:07,282
I don't know the whole thing.
Why do I even need to learn Spanish?

227
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,530
I live in California.
I'm never gonna use it.

228
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,328
That's the problem with Americans.

229
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,497
They expect all of us
to know their language,

230
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,745
but they don't even
make the effort to learn ours.

231
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:20,420
Win a war some time.
Then we'll start talking like you.

232
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,873
Huh! So wrong.

233
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,379
- Oh. Hey, Gloria.
- Hi, Phil. How are you?

234
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,335
- I wish I knew.
- Why? What's wrong?

235
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,091
Oh, I don't want to bum you out.

236
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,844
My doctor did some tests and said
he'd call if something was wrong,

237
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,550
and he called this morning.

238
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:36,349
What did he say? I don't know. I missed the call.
Now I can't reach him.

239
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,930
The black mouse.

240
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,729
What? In my dream.
It was a bad omen.

241
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,435
But probably not for you.

242
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:47,029
The staircase!

243
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:48,823
No, no, no.
You're fine, you're fine.

244
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,992
Am I? Get this.

245
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,695
Fifteen years ago,
I won a lifetime supply of razor blades.

246
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,826
They ran out ... today.

247
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,460
What's with the spitting?
Are you warding off death?

248
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:02,003
No. When I did-

249
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,422
I think I suck in a little bug.

250
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,375
Sixteen for the first race,

251
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,052
ten from the second race,
plus 34.

252
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,222
Sixty dollars!
You're a genius, Dad.

253
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,970
Well, I cannot
take all the credit.

254
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,392
It is a particularly chatty group
of horses today.

255
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,344
I love gambling!
it's so easy.

256
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,096
It's not easy.
Well, not for you.

257
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,855
- You've lost, what, three in a row?
- Oh, burn, Jay.

258
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,812
I'm sorry. That was uncalled for.
This is all so heady.

259
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,897
Fifty dollars on Little Bacon to win.

260
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,945
Yeah, uy.

261
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,573
- What? What ooh-ee?
- There is something not right about that horse.

262
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,536
I think I saw it too.
You didn't see anything.

263
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,707
This horse is a heavy favorite. The rest of
the pack couldn't beat a merry-go-round.

264
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,409
- I'm stickin' with Little Bacon.
- It's your funeral.

265
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,629
Who are we goin' with, Dad?
Nobody in this race, papito.

266
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,799
It was quiet down there in the
paddock just now. Too quiet.

267
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,922
Oh, gee. You know what?
Make it 300.

268
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,218
Oh, my.

269
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,467
I'm tellin' you, kid, this is the one.

270
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,219
And you know how I know?

271
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,642
'Cause it said-

272
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,928
They don't talk like that.

273
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:07,561
"Maria bought a beautiful
white dress for her wedding."

274
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:08,736
Um-

275
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,405
Maria comporó ...

276
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:16,487
un hermoso vestido bianco
para su-

277
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,570
I- I'm sorry.

278
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,201
I cannot concentrate
with him here.

279
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,157
What are you doing?

280
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,001
Just taking it all in.

281
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:31,130
You're a beautiful,
intelligent woman,

282
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,086
and don't you ever forget it.

283
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,596
Wow. He is so weird sometimes.

284
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,143
No, he's not weird!

285
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:43,563
He's a saint, and you will
miss him when he's gone!

286
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,140
One day.

287
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,942
Hey, Uncle Mitchell.
Hey.

288
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,815
Your, uh, phone's on the table.

289
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,233
- Uh, what's that?
- Oh, Cam's old fishing trophy.

290
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,660
Yeah, when I woke up this morning,
that's where I found it.

291
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,033
- Right after you got yours?
- Thank you!

292
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,990
Oh, my God.
Welcome to my world.

293
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:04,496
Last week, I got this beautiful plaque
from the debate team ...

294
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,577
for outstanding achievement,
and what did my morn do?

295
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,129
She found one of Luke's
participant ribbons ...

296
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,673
and a certificate Haley got for
showing up somewhere on time ...

297
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,967
and put all three of them
together on the same shelf.

298
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,544
It's, like, so unfair.

299
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,300
I was so glad
I talked to Alex ...

300
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,973
because she agreed with every
single thing I was feeling,

301
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:24,100
which made me realize that I was
acting like a 14-year-old girl.

302
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,265
Okay.

303
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,646
Yeah. Yeah. Aaah!

304
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,569
Come on, kid.

305
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,739
I just lost an arm because of you.
Now get your head in the game.

306
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:38,660
Sorry. I can't concentrate
with my dad staring at me.

307
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,203
I just love you so much.

308
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,280
I hope he's talkin' to you.

309
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,834
Uh! Oh, great. Now I'm dead.

310
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,627
I'm going to the bathroom.

311
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,205
You know,
they say that happens.

312
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,877
Hey, Walt.

313
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,514
You ever think about death?

314
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,343
I'm 85.
Death is my roommate.

315
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,178
I got a call from the doctor.

316
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,639
There's a 60% chance I'm gonna die.

317
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:10,521
Ha! Doctors. Said I'd
be dead 10 years ago.

318
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,227
Look at me.
I'm healthy as a-

319
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,405
Oh. Gotta go change my tank.

320
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:22,363
- Phil, you gotta let this go.
- I'm sorry, Claire.

321
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,197
I don't know how to react
when I find out ...

322
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,328
there's a 70% chance I'm gonna die.

323
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,126
Honey. Listen to me.

324
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,749
You're gonna be fine.

325
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,419
You really think so?
I know so.

326
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:35,967
Claire's my rock.

327
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,885
You know when you're on a plane
and there's turbulence,

328
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,086
you look at the flight attendants,

329
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,513
and if they're still smiling
and serving drinks,

330
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,885
you know everything's
gonna be okay?

331
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,092
That's Claire.

332
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,428
I could also picture her as a cop.

333
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,639
... and into the
final furlong, it's Little Bacon,

334
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,223
followed by Brad's Wax Jacket-

335
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,024
Go, Little Bacon!
Go, Little Bacon!

336
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,852
You got this.
You got this.

337
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:57,690
- Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
- And the winner is number nine, Little Bacon.

338
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:00,241
Yes! I knew it!

339
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,535
You see that, Manny?
Dumb luck always runs out.

340
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,033
But if you live in the real
world and you use your head,

341
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:08,538
not have it in the clouds like
Dr. Dolittle there, you'll do okay.

342
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,368
Guess you should've listened
to Jay on this one, Dad.

343
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,419
You got that right.
You should have listened to Jay.

344
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:13,997
I'll tell you somethin' else.

345
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,424
You can't look in a horse's eyes
and tell there's something wrong.

346
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:19,343
You can't even look in their eyes at the same time.
One's here and one's here.

347
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,638
Come on, let's go
to the window, kid.

348
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,305
I may need some help
carrying my winnings.

349
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:24,678
Oh, wait.

350
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,844
Jay, look.
Huh?

351
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,933
Inquiry.

352
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:33,524
What's that? It is when a horse
has committed an infraction.

353
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,273
Possible infraction. Usually
it's nothing. I'm sure-

354
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,854
The number nine horse,
Little Bacon,

355
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,530
has been disqualified
for interference.

356
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,901
What? The winner is number
six, Brad's Wax Jacket.

357
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:44,736
Ah. You see?

358
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,321
The eyes-

359
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,823
they do not lie.

360
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,493
Tough break, Jay.

361
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,621
Here.

362
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,422
Little something for gas.

363
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,265
Cam was right.
I was being petty.

364
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,139
So I found his box
of old trophies,

365
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,518
and! decided to surprise him by having
them on the mantel when he got home.

366
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,895
Well, I was the one
who was surprised.

367
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,397
I had no idea
how many trophies he had.

368
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,650
First place, and all of them
for different things.

369
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:24,405
Music, football, an' show,
science fair, a chili cook-ofii

370
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:28,455
A lifetime of accolades hidden away,
just so I wouldn't feel bad.

371
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,741
Ugh! That's a mouse.
That's a- Oh!

372
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,246
Ugh!

373
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,624
Oh, disgusting!

374
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,666
No, no. No, Cam.
I-l was gonna make a big display.

375
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,422
I believe you have.

376
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,427
No, no, Cam,
there was a-

377
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,380
Oh! Gross!

378
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:55,812
Listen, Manny, do me a favor and get me a
cappuccino from right over there, okay?

379
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,938
No, it's okay. I got it.

380
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,858
So-

381
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:05,279
You want to talk about what
happened back there? Not at all.

382
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,828
You know, it is not just the horses whose
souls I can read through their eyes.

383
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,621
All right. You really want to know?
I'll tell you.

384
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,076
Okay. I'll leave you alone.
Ah, listen, hang on.

385
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,287
I'm sorry I went after you
like that in front of Manny.

386
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,713
That was wrong.

387
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:22,713
No, I get it. Nobody likes
to lose at the races, hmm?

388
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:25,045
I don't owe this guy anything.

389
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:28,552
He stops by a couple of times
a year to see his kid.

390
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:31,054
It used to be a relief.
Gave me a nice break.

391
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,431
But now Manny and I,
we got our own thing.

392
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:35,605
Look, I know I'm not his dad.

393
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,976
Maybe I don't like the reminder.

394
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,481
Hey. What's up?

395
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:45,531
Oh, my gosh.
What?

396
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,992
We came as soon as we heard.
Heard what?

397
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,694
We heard Phil got bad news
from the doctor.

398
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,913
No. Who told you that?
Gloria.

399
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:55,538
No. I didn't say
that he got bad news.

400
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:58,036
I said that he was
getting bad news. Shh.

401
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,087
You don't know
that he's getting bad news.

402
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,630
I saw a black mouse.

403
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,299
I saw a black mouse!

404
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,884
So he says.

405
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,257
- Okay, you guys-
- This is worse than I thought!

406
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,009
No, it's not.
Listen to me. Listen.

407
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,932
Phil is fine. As a matter of fact, you
should go before he even knows you're here.

408
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,972
No, no. We're staying. We're staying.

409
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,936
We got here as soon as we could.
Oh, my God.

410
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,561
- Did you bring the coffee cake?
- Yes, I have it right here.

411
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,437
He carried it in from the car.
I paid for it.

412
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,644
Listen. Listen to me.

413
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,946
I am very sorry for what
you are going through.

414
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,364
Thank you.

415
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,407
- Who is this?
- Who indeed?

416
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,484
I am Javier Delgado,
Manny's father ...

417
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,454
and Gloria's former
husband and lover. Oh.

418
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,531
I hope you do not think
this is insensitive,

419
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,334
but you are a beautiful woman, and
you will have no trouble to find a-

420
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:41,538
Javier, the body
is not even cold yet.

421
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:45,376
The body is upstairs watching basketball.
He is fine.

422
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,797
Gloria said he was sick.
No. He went to the doctor.

423
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,096
He had some tests.
The doctor called. That's it.

424
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:54,551
Plus, today he ran out
of his lifetime supply of razors.

425
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,308
That's a sign.
This is a lot of hocus-pocus.

426
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,480
I can't believe I bought
a coffee cake over this!

427
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,434
Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, I'm-I'm confused.
What did the doctor say exactly?

428
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,235
I don't know.
We missed his call this morning.

429
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,359
- The doctor called on Saturday?
- Yeah. So?

430
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:08,610
Nothing.

431
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,783
Not nothing. Not nothing.
What?

432
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,993
Well, it's just that, uh,

433
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,572
doctors don't usually call
on Saturday with good news.

434
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,330
But they could call.

435
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,999
I mean, he could call
with anything.

436
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,873
Do you think he's sick, Dad?

437
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,955
What's- What's going on?

438
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:25,836
Nothing. Nothing.

439
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,667
Everybody just came by
for absolutely no reason at all.

440
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,424
- You look worried.
- I'm not worried.

441
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,005
Oh, God.

442
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,715
The plane's in trouble.

443
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,846
You put away the drink cart
and you're strappin' in.

444
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,718
You're gonna be fine, kid.
You are gonna be great.

445
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:41,060
I wish I looked
as good as this kid.

446
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,481
Stop. Please.
You're freaking me out.

447
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,058
- Are you gonna die?
- I don't know!

448
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,984
There's still
a five percent chance I'll make it!

449
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,482
It's Dr. Sendroff.
Okay.

450
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,569
Guys, I don't know what's on the
other end of this phone call,

451
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,404
but whatever happens,

452
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:59,206
I just want you to know you've already
given me a lifetime supply of happiness.

453
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,783
I remember once, as a-

454
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,209
The phone!
Answer it!

455
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,831
Do it!

456
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,333
Dr. Sendroff.

457
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:06,915
What's the word?

458
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,800
- Are you serious?
- What?

459
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,472
- That's it?
- What is it?

460
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,141
Hold on one second.

461
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,469
He's calling about a real estate listing.
I'm fine.

462
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,054
Oh, my-
Ay, no.

463
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,481
Yesterday, you said you'd call
if something was wrong.

464
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,480
Then you called.
Then you disappeared.

465
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,937
That is the most irresponsible,
unprofessional thing ...

466
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,862
I've ever heard of
in my entire life,

467
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:34,442
and do you have anyone to represent you
in the sale of your current house?

468
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:35,868
Look into his eyes.

469
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,366
I don't care what the doctor says,
I give him six months.

470
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,287
Stop staring.

471
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,668
So, Phil Dunphy, tell
us a little bit about yourself.

472
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,504
Well, Chip, I'm married
to a great lady- Hi, Claire-

473
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,055
and I have a baby girl.

474
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,724
Um, I'm a real estate agent,
and I enjoy playing checkers-

475
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,684
Okay.
both Chinese and American.

476
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,479
And, uh, I am a fan of hip-hop.

477
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:05,056
Well, good for you.

478
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:07,562
Though I try to stay neutral in the
whole East Coast West Coast thang.

479
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,435
Next up, we have-
Oh, one quick thing.

480
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,486
Shout out to my, uh, college
buddy, Ling,

481
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:14,691
who built his own helicopter and
is taking his first flight today.

482
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:18,865
And, uh, I also want to wish a happy anniversary
to my in-laws, Jay and Dede Pritchett.

483
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,493
Your eternal love
is an inspiration to us all.

484
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,370
Okay, that's enough.

485
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:26,123
Next up, we have homemaker from
West Mifflin, Pennsylvania.

486
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:27,499
Hi.

487
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,375
English - US - PSDH
