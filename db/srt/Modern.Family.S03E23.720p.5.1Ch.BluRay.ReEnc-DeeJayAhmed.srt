1
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:05,180
Oh, Phil, honey,
you're still up.

2
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:06,848
Okay.
How does this sound?

3
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:08,892
"Mitchell,
I love you very much.

4
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:11,971
I not only love you, but I
admire you, and someday"-

5
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:13,852
Are you firing him
or proposing to him?

6
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:16,434
Honey, this was supposed to be
a part-time job.

7
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,190
He was gonna be done
in the summer anyway.

8
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,688
Just ... be direct.
I should have warned him.

9
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:23,149
How do you tell someone they have
a reputation for being lazy?

10
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:25,696
Mitchell, lazy?
Yeah, yeah.

11
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:28,746
He handed in a couple of contracts late,
but I didn't want to say anything ...

12
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,413
because he's practically
doing this for free.

13
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:33,618
I can't do this! This isn't the face of
a cold-blooded hatchet man.

14
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,244
Hmm.
Will you do it?

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,338
Hey.

16
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:41,166
Oh. I'm sorry.
Did we wake you up?

17
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,969
No, I was up.
Worried about tomorrow.

18
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,138
My art teacher
acts like I don't exist.

19
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:49,558
But I've one last chance to impress him
at our year-end an fair.

20
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:52,512
A few students are doing
living versions of famous paintings.

21
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,562
I've chosen this one,
and I'm using my own family.

22
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:56,140
Brilliant, right?

23
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:59,067
When I told him, he said,
"That's nice, Alice."

24
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,644
It's been a year.

25
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,570
Alice? Really?

26
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,068
Honey, do you think
you're nervous ...

27
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,615
because you've got
a little crush on Mr. Jarvis?

28
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,575
No. Are you sure? Because
I've seen the way you-

29
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,824
Sounds like you're the one
with the crush.

30
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,031
I've just never had a teacher
not like me before.

31
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:13,661
Well, Miss Davis.
Mmm.

32
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,162
Please. She's a gym teacher.

33
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,336
She's to teaching
what Dr. Seuss is to medicine.

34
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,505
And to think
she didn't like you.

35
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,254
You?
What's your problem?

36
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,755
Nothing. I'm just
excited for tomorrow.

37
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:28,385
I'm getting a medal at school
because I put out a fire.

38
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:31,182
Maybe that's what I should be
when I grow up-

39
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:33,386
a professional medal-getter.

40
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,773
- Luke, what happened?
- I don't know.

41
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:42,353
I was just walking by
and I smelled flames.

42
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,733
I was there.

43
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,031
I don't like this.
We're not supposed to be in here.

44
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,483
Just keep a lookout.

45
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,534
We're 10 seconds away
from creating Luketonium.

46
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:53,330
- Oh, crap!
- Look what you did!

47
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,952
- Luke, what happened?
- I don't know.

48
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:00,879
I was just walking by
and I smelled flames.

49
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,219
Okay, guys. You're gonna be dragging tomorrow
if you don't go to bed right now. Let's go.

50
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,262
Fine. Come on, Alice.

51
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:10,840
I'll be up
in a minute.

52
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:19,352
Mitchell, I can't tell you
how hard- how hard this-

53
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:22,275
No, that's not personal enough.

54
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,983
Okay, okay.

55
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,819
I can't tell you how hurt
and angry this makes me,

56
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,654
but you've been late
too many times.

57
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,239
I'll need your keys.

58
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,915
Daddy, no.
I'm so sorry.

59
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,789
Honey, I didn't hear you come downstairs.
You couldn't sleep either?

60
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,586
Uh, yeah.

61
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:45,041
No, there's just, like,
a lot on my mind-

62
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:48,502
with graduation
and what to wear-

63
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,087
How does this look?

64
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,423
Wait a second.
You're carrying your shoes.

65
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:56,180
How am I supposed to judge
the whole outfit? Put 'em on.

66
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,761
Oh.

67
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,514
# Hey, hey #

68
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,599
# Hey, hey #

69
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,685
# Hey, hey #

70
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,691
# Hey, hey #

71
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,942
# Hey ##

72
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:13,319
So make sure you give this menu
here a good, thorough reading.

73
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,616
Soup.
You didn't even look at it.

74
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,913
Soup. Check out what's below
the soup- Sandwiches.

75
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,870
Have you check out
what is below this outfit?

76
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,796
This doesn't come
from sandwiches.

77
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,623
Look.

78
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:29,927
"The Jay Pritchett"?
I don't understand.

79
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,379
They named you after a sandwich?

80
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,430
No, they named a sandwich
after me.

81
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:38,682
Turkey, bacon, Swiss cheese, red
peppers, anchovies on wheat?

82
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,387
Most people stop
after salty bacon,

83
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,063
but I double down
with anchovies.

84
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,392
Were you making a sandwich
or attracting deer?

85
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,397
Is this bum
bothering you, miss?

86
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:49,104
I should get a picture of this.
An actual waitress sighting in this dump.

87
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:52,908
I took a chance and put in
an order for your sandwich,

88
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:55,782
although most people
like their Jay Pritchetts to go.

89
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,951
What's happening?
Gloria, it's Maxine.

90
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,532
So you're married to Jay.

91
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,413
Where'd you tie up
your Seeing Eye dog?

92
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,745
No, no, I'm not, um-

93
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,377
Okay, I get it. I get it.

94
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,966
Here's that number for that neck
doctor I want you to see. Thanks.

95
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,543
What's wrong
with your neck?

96
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,799
For 30 years, I've been
hearing it's a handball injury,

97
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,382
but it always seems
to get worse with stress.

98
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,138
Maybe it's that audit
he's got comin' up.

99
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,763
- Audit?
- Nothing.

100
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,562
Oh, isn't that cute?
He doesn't want you to worry.

101
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,775
Here's your sandwich.
Now you should worry.

102
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,693
Look at it.
My prettiest child.

103
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,485
Why didn't you tell me about your neck?
it's fine. Take a bite.

104
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,279
Your company's getting audited?
Nothing!

105
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,281
Three bad days, then it's over. Come on!
I'm anxious to hear what you think.

106
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,783
Uh-huh?
Uh-huh?

107
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,536
I see it growin' on you.

108
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,205
It's like Maxine when she first
tried it- I don't like it.

109
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:47,956
You probably didn't get all- Hey, I try it.
I don't like it.

110
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,707
That's all you can say? It
tastes bad in my mouth.

111
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:55,012
It's like a fish and a turkey beat
themselves to death with a pepper.

112
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,305
Okay, fair enough.
Maybe a little picky, though,

113
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,303
from someone who prepared
a Colombian specialty ...

114
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,727
and said, "Why are you not eating the hooves?
They're the best part."

115
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:05,848
I'm back!

116
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:08,104
Oh, hey, Uncle Cam.

117
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,231
Oh, thanks again
for picking me up last night.

118
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,358
You're welcome. But you
have to be more careful.

119
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,984
I was the responsible one.

120
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,941
Lisa was drinking, and I took
her keys, and then everything-

121
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,276
I understand.

122
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,737
My senior year, I had a
pretty crazy night myself,

123
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,243
involving a bottle of corn
mash and an overturned plow.

124
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:24,162
Seriously? Yeah. You
don't know terror ...

125
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,619
until you've had to stare down the
eyes of a Missouri state trooper ...

126
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,453
and talk your way
out of a P.U.I.

127
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,298
Honey,
you don't drink coffee.

128
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:33,842
I do when I've been up
half the night ...

129
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,635
worrying about a project
that's only one-third done,

130
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,758
and I still have an apron to sew,
scenery to paint ...

131
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,682
plus my normal
crushing workload, so-

132
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,885
Unless you have a better way
for me to stimul-

133
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,888
God.
Coffee's bitter.

134
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,814
That was your first sip?

135
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,517
Okay, I got the chafing dish,
salt and pepper shakers.

136
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,273
Perfect matches, both.

137
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,446
I may have to
readjust my grapes.

138
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:57,400
Huh. Wow. I'll just give
you a little privacy.

139
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,323
Welcome back
to the light show.

140
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,286
Hi.
Hi, Lily.

141
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,285
Hi, Daddy.

142
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,292
Lily. Sweetheart, no.

143
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,540
No, no, no, no. We're-
We're not gonna do that today.

144
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,668
Actually- Actually, Claire, we're trying
not to use the word "no" so much.

145
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:16,217
We just read a book that said children
learn to rebel against that word.

146
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,178
Uh-huh. So we redirect her
into a new activity instead.

147
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,427
Here. Well, just watch this.

148
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,600
Lily, sweetie, hi.
It's Daddy here.

149
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,143
Would you like to listen
to some music?

150
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:29,231
Okay. There you go. See?

151
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:32,606
Every new generation thinks they have
cracked the code on child rearing.

152
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:35,153
What's the latest theory?
"Never say no."

153
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,572
I say no every day
in this house.

154
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,274
But at night,
she's a yes machine.

155
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,451
No.

156
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:46,657
Well, it doesn't seem that she is redirecting
her own energy as much as using a lot of ours.

157
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,416
But do you see how she's slowly
transitioning from the lights to the music?

158
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,872
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.

159
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:58,461
It's hard to believe there was ever a time
when we just said, "Stop doing that."

160
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:01,054
The garbage disposal.

161
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,597
Lily. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

162
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:06,176
Not- Let's redirect you
into a nap, huh?

163
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:10,272
Actually, we're doing this new thing where we
let her tell us when she wants to take a nap.

164
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,475
It's called "being
your own nap captain."

165
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,980
Mm-hmm.
Come on, sweetie.

166
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,364
Hey, hey.
Phil.

167
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,535
Hey. Did you
ring the doorbell?

168
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,410
Oh, no, 'cause I have
these two coffees.

169
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,203
One is for you.
Thank you.

170
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,501
Here's my life-
A full-time job,

171
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,954
a three-year-old
and a second one on the way.

172
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:38,292
And as a favor, I agreed to do a
little work for Phil's agency.

173
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,798
The problem is, I'm very good,

174
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,426
and the more I do,
the more they want me.

175
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,303
L-I even turned in
a few assignments late ...

176
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,430
so that they'd fall out of
love with me a little bit.

177
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,307
Right.

178
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,309
How- How long have you
been standing here?

179
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,272
Are-Are you- Are you all right?
Oh, yeah.

180
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:57,353
- 'Cause you're really blinking.
- Mm-mmm.

181
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,937
I'm a stress blinker.

182
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,320
Um, and what really
gets me going is confrontation.

183
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,029
Hate it. I-l avoid it at all costs.
Terrible at it.

184
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,614
Once, I-l, uh- I tried to
break up with a girl,

185
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:12,668
and I danced around it so much, she
didn't know I had broken up with her.

186
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,665
Twenty years later,
we're still married.

187
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,964
I am ... really sorry ...

188
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,838
about the cold coffee.

189
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:24,137
It's not that cold.
it's lukewarm, so-

190
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:26,131
Okay, so- Funny story
about that expression.

191
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:30,136
When the kids were younger, we had
a, uh- a wading pool. Uh-huh.

192
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,267
And occasionally Luke would have an
accident and, um, Alex would scream.

193
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,850
And we'd say, um, "It's okay, honey.
He's just making it lukewarm."

194
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,401
What else? What else? So I
gotta get going, but I, uh-

195
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,858
Okay, wait. I'm just gonna
come straight out and say it.

196
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,943
Mitchell, you've done
a wonderful job for the agency ...

197
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,246
since you decided you'd
help us out forjust a little bit.

198
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,539
We couldn't
ask for more, could we?

199
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,332
I wish it didn't have to end.

200
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:56,833
In fact, if it was up to me,
you'd stay on forever, but it is not-

201
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,206
Phil, Phil.
just up to me, is it, so-

202
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:02,634
Phil, I saw this coming,
and-and- Look.

203
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:07,222
I bailed. I made an
excuse and left.

204
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,174
But I-I've- I've gotta be
straight with him.

205
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,931
You know, "Phil, I cannot stay
on with your firm forever."

206
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,513
Oh, God,
it's gonna crush him.

207
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,690
Maybe I can get Claire
to do it.

208
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,188
Well, that was easy.

209
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,606
We're really proud of you, buddy.
See you at the ceremony.

210
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,494
You're not a hero.

211
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,534
I put out a fire.
A fire you started.

212
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,076
Was there a fire?
Yes.

213
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,620
Did I put it out?
That's not-

214
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,835
Answer the question.
Yes.

215
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,833
I'm getting an award for it.

216
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,882
If they gave awards for starting fires,
I'd be getting one of those too.

217
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,709
I know you have
a conscience, Luke.

218
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,763
Do you see this flag?
It stands for justice.

219
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,635
So when that fire marshal
gets here,

220
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:53,184
I know you're going to look at
that flag, do the right thing.

221
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,107
You were very quiet
all the way home.

222
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,905
Are you upset at me because
I honked at that old lady?

223
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,075
Normally we leave the honking to
the driver, but I'm used to it.

224
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,993
Is it because
of the sandwich?

225
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:14,539
You maybe could've eaten half of
it, said a couple of nice things.

226
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,537
It's just a sandwich, Jay.

227
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,664
It's not about
the delicious sandwich, Gloria.

228
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,587
It's about being respectful
of a person's feelings.

229
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,290
But I was
just being honest.

230
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,796
You don't have to be honest about
every little thing in a relationship.

231
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,128
Some things you say,
some things you don't.

232
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:31,055
Oh. What are the things
that you don't say?

233
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,924
Gloria, I really don't want to
do this anymore. Oh, really?

234
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,223
But you cannot just try to teach me
a lesson and then not- Okay, fine.

235
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,896
I don't say this, but it ...

236
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:42,818
bothers me a little bit
that you're just a tiny bit loud.

237
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:43,981
Loud?
Not all the time.

238
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,858
Only when you-
you know, when you talk.

239
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,778
So I embarrass you?
Gloria.

240
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,280
What? Am I
being too loud again?

241
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,495
All right. Buckle up.
Oh.

242
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,868
I'm gonna go
and try to do the laundry,

243
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:58,496
and I'm gonna do it very
quietly so I don't bother you.

244
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,077
Maybe Manny can help me.

245
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,296
Manny.
I get it.

246
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,757
Manny.
I get it.

247
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,424
Now you're not even
making any noise.

248
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:15,968
Okay, this is
way too many grapes.

249
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,178
And this spoon is modern
day, so if we use it,

250
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:20,764
everyone at the table has to react in
shock at the spoon from the future.

251
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:21,848
Okay-

252
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,353
And that went
down the drain.

253
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,026
And you need a nap.

254
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,899
You need a nap.

255
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:29,072
I got it. Ooh, I lost it. Shoot.

256
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:31,445
Let me know if I can eliminate
any distractions for you.

257
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,994
I got it. No, I got a finger on it.
There it is. Oh, lost it again.

258
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,742
Maybe you should just
wait until it comes to you.

259
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,495
You know, make it the captain
of its own spoon platoon.

260
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,326
I understand the point
you're making, Claire, but-

261
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,127
Oh, now I'm stuck.

262
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:46,332
Yeah, Cam. You are stuck. You are stuck on
a philosophy that clearly doesn't work.

263
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:49,133
Sometimes you need to
say "no" to a child.

264
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,712
Yeah, and sometimes you
need to say "no" to an adult.

265
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:55,139
No, Claire, no. I don't need help
raising my child.

266
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,135
Oh, okay.
Sorry.

267
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,188
Guess I do have a lot to learn.

268
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:04,857
Right now, I'm looking forward to learning
if you will get your arm out of there ...

269
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,857
before Lily gets
to the garbage disposal switch.

270
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,237
Um- Lily, sweetie?

271
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,739
- Can-Can you do something, please, Claire?
- I would like to, really.

272
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,491
I would. But I would
probably just say no ...

273
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,289
and shred her confidence
and mangle her self-esteem.

274
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:23,539
Okay, fine. I'm sorry. Stop her! Stop her!
What to do? What to do?

275
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:25,245
- Sweetie! Claire!
- What to do?

276
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:30,376
Oh! Oh!

277
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,343
Yes!  Ohh.

278
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,928
Ohh.

279
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:37,883
You think
that's funny, don't you?

280
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,476
Yes. Well, it's wicked, Claire.
It's wicked.

281
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,054
Come on.
We're leaving, Lily. Lily!

282
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:48,268
It's living art. We stay perfectly still
for 90 seconds, basically doing nothing.

283
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:51,567
Sounds like my first wife. I don't know.
She always moved for me.

284
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:54,024
Long as you both agree
it was only 90 seconds.

285
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,780
Two nerds with one stone!

286
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,326
I love working in an office.

287
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,575
Is that your brother-in-law?
I thought you fired him.

288
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:02,407
- I did. Before work.
- Then what's he doin' here?

289
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,333
Is he disgruntled?
He looks disgruntled.

290
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,286
No, he always
looks like that.

291
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:09,039
Hey. How's it goin'? Hey.

292
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,591
Hey, listen. Okay, I know
this is uncomfortable,

293
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,044
but we really need to talk
about my future here.

294
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,762
But I- I thought we-
No, I know, I know.

295
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:19,307
I led you to believe that I'd be able
to stay on here indefinitely and-

296
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,760
Okay, okay.
Don't get all blinky.

297
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,137
Oh.  it's not
all bad news, okay?

298
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,938
You will have me until
July, like we agreed.

299
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,436
Okay, great.

300
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,525
Could you jump on the elevator
with me real quick? Yes, yes.

301
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,942
I could use a hand carrying up some stuff
from my car.

302
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,865
Oh, my goodness. I probably
need some empty boxes, don't I?

303
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,443
You know what? You head down.
I'll meet you at the glass doors.

304
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,449
There was something else. What was it?
I know it's in there.

305
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,789
Oh, yeah. You're fired.
What? Fired?

306
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:47,370
What's goin'
on with these things?

307
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,791
You tryin' to open 'em?
Mm-hmm.

308
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,589
I better get somebody.

309
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,962
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You're firing me?

310
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:57,342
- I don't even like this job.
- That can't be safe.

311
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,218
- Someone trapped in there?
- The guy they fired.

312
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,425
- Oh, the lazy guy?
- Lazy?

313
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,885
You handed in a couple of things late.
I should've warned you.

314
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,515
I'm terrible
at breaking bad news.

315
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:08,269
Then why did you come over to my
house and tell me how great I was?

316
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,225
That was me
trying to fire you.

317
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:13,278
I haven't felt like this since I tried
to break up with Claire 20 years ago.

318
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,072
- Someone stuck again?
- That lawyer with the attitude they just fired.

319
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:19,651
They said it was your attitude,
like you were doing us a favor.

320
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,657
I was doing you a favor.

321
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:24,239
- Why didn't he take the stairs like everyone else?
- Lazy.

322
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:28,835
Don't worry.
He can't get you.

323
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,210
Two hours I was stuck in there, with an
entire office of people staring at me.

324
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:35,383
L- I finally had to lie down.

325
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,295
Didn't help my reputation.

326
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,215
Figures.

327
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,937
You guys nailed it.

328
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:58,982
Dude, that was surreal.
Get it?

329
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:02,194
Dad, come on.
We have a minute to set up!

330
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,744
Where are Mitchell and Cam?

331
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,448
Hey, Manny. Thanks for what
you said before about the flag.

332
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,166
It really got me thinking. I
knew you had a conscience, Luke.

333
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,165
More importantly,
you've got a good-

334
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,413
You didn't.
Yep.

335
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:16,875
And thanks to you, I had them move the
ceremony to right under the flag.

336
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,710
I'll sign a picture
for you.

337
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,677
- Oh, there you are. I was afraid you weren't coming.
- It was a discussion.

338
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,509
If we weren't gonna show up, we
would have clearly let you know ...

339
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,139
and not humiliated you
in public.

340
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,768
If it's any consolation, the
lawyer we hired to replace you ...

341
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,349
is already
suing the elevator company.

342
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:33,900
Ow! You're sitting on my hand.

343
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,648
Be thankful you have two.
I almost lost one today.

344
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,024
Stop being such a baby.
She was nowhere near that switch.

345
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,106
Shh! Keep your voices down.
We're about to go on.

346
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,692
Why are you looking at me?
Am I too loud?

347
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,903
- Is that what everybody thinks?
- What?

348
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,114
- There's a backstory here you don't want to know about.
- I want turkey.

349
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,948
Save your
appetite, baby girl.

350
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,284
And don't forget, afterwards we're
goin' to Lenny's for a bite to eat.

351
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,165
More than a bite,
if you value my feelings.

352
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:54,837
Oh, great.
We get to see Maxine.

353
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,539
What?
You know Maxine too?

354
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,249
- Oh, we all know Maxine.
- Love.

355
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:02,508
Second best hugger in the world after
Mr. Burt Reynolds. Story to follow.

356
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:05,807
Guys, this will all be over in 90 seconds.
Hold your poses.

357
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,976
I really want to impress
Mr. Gorgeous.

358
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,302
Jarvis! Shut up!

359
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:12,138
Hey, Mitch,
I know this isn't a good time.

360
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,064
I just want you to know,
I'm really-

361
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,642
I know, Phil.
You're really sorry, okay?

362
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:18,148
But this is gonna take me
a little time to get over, all right?

363
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,275
Actually, I was gonna say I'm really
gonna need your parking pass.

364
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,865
What?  Our
next stage presentation ...

365
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,318
will be
Alex Dunphyis interpretation ...

366
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,120
of Norman Rockwell's].943 painting
Freedom from Want.

367
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,615
How do you
sleep at night, Luke?

368
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,492
- With a medal around my neck.
- Shh!

369
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,498
I want turkey.
Lily, no!

370
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,796
She doesn't understand that word.
Cram it, Claire.

371
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:40,000
Control your child, Cam. it's not that difficult.
I've raised three.

372
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,334
Cam!

373
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,761
Why don't you ask Haley
what time she got home last night?

374
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:45,630
Uncle Cam! Sorry, dear.
Collateral damage.

375
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,177
- What is he talking about?
- Shh!

376
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,800
Your arms are shaking.
Oh, yeah.

377
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,011
I'm sure that the great
Maxine can do a better job!

378
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,767
You can criticize my parenting
all you like, Cam,

379
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,519
but my son just won a medal.

380
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:58,021
- For a fire he started.
- Luke, is that true?

381
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,980
- Ow!
- A y, how long? It's getting heavy.

382
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,857
You're not getting that parking pass back.
I tried to let you down easy.

383
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,568
You don't know how
to talk to people, Phil.

384
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,449
It's just like when Claire
didn't even know you dumped her.

385
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,162
What?
When did Dad dump you?

386
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,332
I didn't dump her.
I just tried to.

387
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:15,034
I am losing it!
Just a few more seconds!

388
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:19,042
I want turkey.  Lily, no!

389
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,458
We really are
trying to not say that word.

390
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,340
B-minus.

391
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,341
But there was a silver lining.

392
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:31,009
"L expected more, Alex."

393
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,560
Alex!

394
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,639
I am gonna call Haley and tell her
we're not going to that deli.

395
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,268
I can't take
another minute of Cam.

396
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:40,147
You know, I'm not even sure I believe
all these new parenting theories,

397
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:43,196
but I'll be damned if I'm gonna
let her tell me they're wrong.

398
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:44,739
We are not
going to dinner.

399
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,487
I tried that sandwich.

400
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,409
It's not that good.
You're not missing anything.

401
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,862
I sure won't miss seeing
Luke and that stupid medal.

402
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:53,073
I play by the rules.
Where's my medal?

403
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:56,580
Jay can stay with that Maxine.
She's not loud, like me.

404
00:17:56,659 --> 00:18:01,005
In fairness, you can be a
little quick to give advice.

405
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,799
Well, I'm always ready to help,
if that's what you mean, yeah.

406
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:08,755
Yeah, but if you're not careful, it can
come off a little ... know-it-all-y.

407
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,215
That's not a word.

408
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:14,553
What you mean to say is it can
come off like I know it all.

409
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:17,806
Have I always been this way? It's
why I wanted to break up with you.

410
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,232
The word "fired"
doesn't even apply.

411
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,106
You can't get fired
from a favor.

412
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,403
Okay, sweetie.
Maybe you should just let it go.

413
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,947
Like I always say, it's better
to carry a tune than a grudge.

414
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,276
Okay,
you never said that, but-

415
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,656
And what about this grudge
you're holding against Claire?

416
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,534
I don't see you
trading that in for a tune.

417
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,537
That is completely different. She
insulted my parenting skills.

418
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:39,210
Which, you have to admit, you
can be pretty defensive about.

419
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,835
Okay, so maybe we both
can be a little sensitive.

420
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,087
N-No, no.
Mm-mmm, no.

421
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,010
These are-
These are not equal.

422
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,179
No, you have no idea what
it feels like to be fired.

423
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,723
Yes, I do. I've been fired.
Everyone has.

424
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,300
Not me.

425
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:56,723
Never?
No. Nope.

426
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,271
I've always been very
good at what I do.

427
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:00,894
So then maybe
what you're feeling ...

428
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,227
is a little insecure about
your work for the first time.

429
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,443
That's hogwash.

430
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:11,196
As someone who's seen actual hogwash,
I can assure you that it's not.

431
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:14,654
I don't know why you're so
bothered by Maxine. She's nice.

432
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:19,413
Oh, good. Why don't you, Jay and Maxine
live together eating sandwiches forever?

433
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,495
Can I float
a theory here, Mom?

434
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,544
You sound like you're jealous.
A y, please.

435
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:28,092
Me, jealous of that woman?

436
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,920
I just don't like the way
they talk to each other.

437
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,678
And the little jokes, and she
knows everything about his life.

438
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:37,601
Just makes me
feel like, uh-

439
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,564
Is that jealous?

440
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,940
A y, my poor sisters.

441
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,783
Just you? I thought the whole
family was swinging by.

442
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,156
Who knows what they're doin'? Right now
they're all sniping at each other.

443
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,746
Ah, who needs 'em? Right. As
long as I have you, Maxine-

444
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,870
I'm off in five.
Hey, Luke.

445
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,997
What's with
all the hardware?

446
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:04,829
Well, he set fire to his school
and lied about it.

447
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:07,833
You know, they give medals for anything these days.
it's going back tomorrow.

448
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:11,419
He doesn't get
a lot of medals.

449
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,468
I just really need one of these today.

450
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,386
Don't hold back.
Ohh.

451
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,092
My girls.
There they are.

452
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,677
Hello, hello.

453
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,354
Hey, Cam. Hey!

454
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,899
Come on in.

455
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,983
- I, uh- I appreciate your coming.
- Yeah.

456
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,530
And again, I really, really-

457
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:32,739
Thank you.
Yeah.

458
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,985
Here she is. Look who made it.

459
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,570
Hola, Maxine.
So nice to see you.

460
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,823
Let me get you some menus.
We don't need it.

461
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,907
It's Jay Pritchetts
all around.

462
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,255
Gloria, if you want your sandwich
without anchovies, I won't be offended.

463
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,797
Ohh.

464
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,546
Course, then it'll
be a Jack Feldman.

465
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,342


466
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,841
Hey, have you ever gotten
a hug from Maxine?

467
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,305
Hey. Yeah?

468
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,102
- Hey, man.
- ls the repair guy here?

469
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:03,805
He's workin' on it.
Um-

470
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,516
Listen, uh, it's Katie's birthday-
Skip's assistant.

471
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,522
Big 3-0. Still no ring.

472
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,320
- You woke me up to tell me that?
- No. I grabbed you some cake.

473
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,272
Oh. Sure it's not
for employees only?

474
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,948
Okay, had that coming.

475
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,776
- Who are you talking to, Phil?
- Mitchell.

476
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:19,703
- Who?
- Mitchell, my bro- Uh, the lazy guy.

477
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,373
Who was
doing you a favor.

478
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:23,916
All right. Just give me the cake.
I'm hungry.

479
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,455
No!

480
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,249
Oh.

481
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,167
English - US - PSDH
