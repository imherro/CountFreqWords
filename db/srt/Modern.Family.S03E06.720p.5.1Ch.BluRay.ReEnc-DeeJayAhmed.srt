1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,596
There she is.
The old library.

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,639
Had some late nights
in there.

3
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:08,513
Some of 'em
I even spent studying.

4
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:10,094
Don't tell your morn.

5
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:12,054
And maybe don't tell me.
Oh.

6
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,890
College!

7
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,768
He was shielding his eyes from the sun.
Knew it when I hit it.

8
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,694
Phil is taking Haley
to visit his alma mater.

9
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,023
Loved college.

10
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:25,200
Mmm. We are hoping some of that
enthusiasm rubs off on her.

11
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,073
Go Bullfrogs!

12
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,325
Dogs. Bulldogs.

13
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,448
I feel like you do that on purpose.
Mm-mmm.

14
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:35,457
No, it's just I say "bull," and I
can't remember if it's frogs or dogs.

15
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:39,757
When I talk to my old friends from
college, do we croak or do we bark?

16
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,879
I got it.

17
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:45,721
Hello.

18
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,056
Wow.

19
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:55,480
No way. Haley, no way!
Check it out!

20
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,900
After a few beers, my buds and I
would jump on these lunch trays ...

21
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:59,397
and race down
this same hill.

22
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:01,020
Hop on.
I don't want to hop on.

23
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,238
Seriously. You'll get the giggles.
I don't want the giggles.

24
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:06,450
Hey, honey.

25
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,160
Hawk the trip going?
So good.

26
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:11,326
Go Bullfrogs!

27
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,574
It's dogs!
Oh, sorry.

28
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:17,036
- How's Haley doing?
- She's-

29
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,130
She's loving it.
She's loving it.

30
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:21,874
Ready! I showed
her the student union.

31
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:24,673
Five, six, seven, eight.
We visited the dorms.

32
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,549
We sat in on a class.

33
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:29,302
I really think she's starting to
see what college has to offer.

34
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,516
Oh, hang on, Claire.

35
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,394
Go Bulldogs!

36
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:44,106
# Hey, hey #

37
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,609
# Hey ##

38
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,777
Manny, who is this Bella girl,

39
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,239
and why is her name
all over your notebook?

40
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:54,790
Bella's no girl, Mom.

41
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:58,335
She has recently blossomed,
like a purple lilac in April.

42
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,253
What do you mean, she blossom?

43
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,293
Like the puberty?
Yep.

44
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:04,633
I'll get it.

45
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,881
Hey, Gloria, your
show's about to start.

46
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:09,300
Record it.
No, the DVR's filling up.

47
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,598
Let's just watch
and get it over with.

48
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,597
Gloria's always saying we
should do more stuff together.

49
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:18,146
So I agreed to watch this crazy
Colombian soap opera she loves.

50
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,894
Fuego y hielo.

51
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,193
Which apparently is Spanish
for "big hair and yelling."

52
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,236
Fire and Ice.

53
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,110
It's about human suffering.

54
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:29,408
I relate to it.

55
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:32,111
I'm just saying, the guy's a judge.
He could put a shirt on.

56
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,497
A y, what is that?
Oh, nothing.

57
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,246
That doesn't look like a nothing.
What is inside?

58
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,827
Oh, it's just something
I bought

59
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,787
I'm gonna go open it
in my room.

60
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,168
I don't like this.

61
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,500
Manny has never
kept a secret from me.

62
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,378
Don't worry about it. What
do you think it could be?

63
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:52,635
Well, right now, I'm a little worried
it could be the rest of my evening.

64
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,426
Mwah! Bye-bye. Love you.

65
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,728
Hey, Claire, listen. Uh,
if you want, some of the moms ...

66
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:00,647
are going to stay and watch Gone with
the Wind in my new screening room.

67
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,190
I got Pinot.

68
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:05,189
I would love to, but I'm
not feeling that great, so-

69
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,895
Probably just gonna go home
and rest.

70
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,025
Plus, I've seen that movie.

71
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,823
No, I never saw
Gone with the Wind.

72
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,821
But I have two kids at sleepovers,

73
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,698
and Haley's out of town with Phil.

74
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,575
That means I have
one night to myself,

75
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:17,497
which happens once every never.

76
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,870
I am not spending it
with some gossipy mom ...

77
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,702
who was mean to me
in high school.

78
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,163
I need a fun night out.

79
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,375
What the hell is this?

80
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,256
No, I asked you guys
for a fun night out, not this.

81
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,805
I need music and dancing
and secondhand smoke.

82
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,882
Oh, please give this place a chance.
It's a great value.

83
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:39,561
The room is so cozy, and the
pot pies are to die for.

84
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,559
Are you really comfortable
with what you just said?

85
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,858
Come on. What happened to the party
people who took me to a rave?

86
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:48,437
And I got to wear a tube top, and I stuffed
cash in a caged go-go boy's Speedo.

87
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,238
We're still party people.

88
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,986
Oh, Joanne, before I
forget, can I get a punch?

89
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,318
One away from a free pot pie.

90
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,280
- If that was your gay card, it would be revoked.
- Okay, you know what, Claire?

91
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,864
You're being a little
"high school you."

92
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,915
I am sorry, Mitchell,
but I get one free night,

93
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:04,962
and I can't spend it at a place that is
a proud supporter of Wilson Elementary.

94
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,414
- We all need to give back, Claire.
- Oh, give me back my night.

95
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,592
Okay, well, Longines did invite
us to a boutique opening.

96
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,419
You know, cocktails, deejay.

97
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:15,381
it'll be whole scene though.

98
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,683
A scene? A scene is perfect.
That's great.

99
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,853
I will get in the car before you guys
change your mind. Come on. Let's go.

100
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,474
So does that mean
no pot pies?

101
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:25,353
Uh- Hey, Joanne,
two number nines to go.

102
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,851
Was I wrong?

103
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,650
Are these not the best wings you've
ever had in your life? Oh, my God!

104
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,606
And you didn't want
to get 40.

105
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,568
Oh, and by the way, this is
just the start of your evening.

106
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,280
Next up, it's over to the quad for a
musical interlude from Tenors, Anyone?

107
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,203
It's an all-male singing group.
Got it.

108
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:45,624
Oh, hey! Oh, hey, weren't you
on my tour this morning?

109
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,293
Yeah, I'm Haley, and
this is my- Big brother.

110
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,169
You bought it for a second!
How are you?

111
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,918
Oh. That's-
Okay.

112
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,720
Anyway, you know what? There is a
student mixer going on tonight.

113
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,549
If you want to go, me and a bunch
of girls are gonna head over there.

114
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,475
Oh, uh-

115
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,518
Know what? That's okay.

116
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,473
My dad's got this whole thing
planned, but thank you anyway.

117
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,273
No problem. Well, it
was nice meeting you.

118
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:08,851
Nice meeting you.

119
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:13,401
How fun is this?
Just me and you.

120
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,029
I was a little nervous you wouldn't see
what's so special about this place.

121
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:20,029
Not that I'm pushing you to come here. You
know, you're gonna make your own decisions.

122
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:24,332
You want to go with them, don't you?
No, we're doing our thing.

123
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,330
Yeah, quick, before they leave.

124
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,249
Are you sure?
Go. I can handle it.

125
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,330
You're not the first girl
to leave me at this table ...

126
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,040
with a plateful
of chicken wings.

127
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,796
I'm kidding.

128
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,343
Wish I was kidding.

129
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,757
You weren't supposed
to hear that.

130
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,755
Have fun.
Okay.

131
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,099
Love you.
Love you.

132
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,816
Nose job. Ooh.

133
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:54,237
Butt lift. Last summer, that thing
was four inches off the ground.

134
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,690
What do they do with all
the butt they take out?

135
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,366
I have a theory.

136
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,911
Oh, hell!
Here comes my ex.

137
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,204
Who, Randolph?
Marcus?

138
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,827
- Lamichael?
- No, Matt.

139
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,291
Oh.
I gotta go!

140
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,664
Drama! Love it!

141
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,745
This is what I wanted.

142
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:13,090
Who needs a drink? I could
use a little seltzer water.

143
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,550
More bubbly, Claire? I will
be after I get a drink.

144
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:19,220
See, that's what
gay is supposed to be like.

145
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:22,266
Okay, I don't know about you, but I got
about five minutes of fabulous left in me.

146
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,013
Yeah. In my mind,
I'm already in our kitchen ...

147
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,561
and I'm watching my pot pie
rotate in the microwave.

148
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,730
Okay, okay.
When did hats come back?

149
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:32,025
That one's come back about eight times.
Pick a side of the room, lady!

150
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,274
All right, there's, like, a
thousand people waiting for wine.

151
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,026
I want to try on
a couple of dresses,

152
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,608
and then Julian here is going to
take us to a club across town.

153
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,534
I think we're gonna go home.

154
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,283
What? Why? it's 9:30.

155
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,954
It's 9:30?

156
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,032
When did you two
become such old women?

157
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,413
First you take me to that
senior center for porridge,

158
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,540
and now you can't even stay up
past Luke's bedtime?

159
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,964
It's Friday. We get tired on Fridays.
We get very tired.

160
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,918
I have three children.
I have been tired since 2005.

161
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,502
Let's rally.

162
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:01,680
You're my ride. If you want to
stay out, I can take you home.

163
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,764
Really?
Of course.

164
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,262
Okay.

165
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:08,061
All right, girls, go home, roll up
your hair, clap out the lights,

166
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,810
'cause this guy,
who I just met,

167
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,854
is gonna show me a good time.

168
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,982
Okay, well, if he was straight, this
would be just like high school.

169
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,322
This is ridiculous.

170
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:22,276
She's obviously got a pistol
under that poncho.

171
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,827
How do you watch this stuff?

172
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:27,281
He's been up there for more than one hour.
I can't stand it.

173
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,833
Who's been up there? Reinaldo's doin'
the dishes right in front of her.

174
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,330
Manny, in his bedroom.

175
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,002
Gloria, are you
even watching this?

176
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,580
I'm doin' this for you.

177
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:38,759
What does he has in that box
that he cannot show to me?

178
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,961
Little boys are supposed to
keep secrets from their mothers.

179
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:44,048
Wait. The judge
just peeked through the window.

180
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,259
Is he interested in Celia now?
She could be his daughter.

181
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:51,264
I bet it's a birthday gift for me.
Yeah, that sounds right.

182
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,848
What's he saying?

183
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,899
I've never seen him this mad.

184
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,773
Wait a minute.

185
00:07:56,851 --> 00:08:00,196
I already found my birthday
gift underneath his bed.

186
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,989
It's a giant hat.

187
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,908
When did hats
came back, anyway?

188
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,657
Now she's reaching
under the poncho.

189
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,408
Like she's gonna shoot Reinaldo.

190
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,205
He's the main character, right?

191
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,497
That's it.
I'm going up there.

192
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,995
Wait, Gloria, no, don't go.

193
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,461
Why not? Think about it.
Thirteen-year-old boy.

194
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,129
Talks about girls all day long.

195
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:19,083
We have more security on these
computers than the Pentagon.

196
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,213
What do you think
he's doin' up there, alone?

197
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,593
Do you think
he ordered some movies?

198
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,265
Movies, magazines.
Whatever the hell.

199
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,093
How dare do you say that,
Jay?

200
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,520
He's a little boy!
He's just a boy.

201
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,643
I don't want to talk to you.
I'm gonna take a walk.

202
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,350
Gloria, come on.
Come back.

203
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,231
I know you're not mad at me.

204
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,276
You just-

205
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:42,523
Oh! What'd she do?

206
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,107
Reinaldo!

207
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,614
Oh! Wang chung!

208
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,571
Pay UP, gentlemen!

209
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,624
Oh, yes!

210
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,201
Thank you!

211
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,831
Really? That's so nice.

212
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,753
Another pitcher,
my good woman.

213
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,502
Claire would have killed me
if she'd known ...

214
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:02,551
that I let Haley go off alone while I
chilled in a bar with some undergrads,

215
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,719
but I happen
to trust my daughter.

216
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,136
Also, I was tracking her location
with the G.P.S. on her phone.

217
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,810
Fellas, Cedar and Los Alamos.
That's, uh-

218
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,435
- Pi Chi house?
- Pi Chi?

219
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,984
Come on. Why
is my Bluetooth not working?

220
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:30,367
Oh, God, it's Longines.
He's gonna be so mad at us.

221
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,831
Hey, Longe, don't
be mad at us for leaving.

222
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,829
I went back to our
spot, and everybody was gone.

223
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,410
Who does that to a sister?

224
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,336
We're sorry,
but the sitter called,

225
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,630
and Lily
was running a fever, so-

226
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:44,300
We feel even worse about dumping
Claire on you and your hot date.

227
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,423
Who is gorgeous, by the way.

228
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,346
Seems super funny too.
Perfect for you.

229
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,219
Please.
I wish that was a date.

230
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:53,051
He is my trainer, and he's straight.
What? Julian's straight?

231
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:56,559
Oh, I love it when a straight person
and a gay person go out together.

232
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,436
I'd love it a lot more
if he was gay.

233
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,108
Oh, my God.
This isn't our car.

234
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,602
What?
This isn't our Prius.

235
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,937
They must've given us the
wrong one at the valet.

236
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,693
That's why the Bluetooth
isn't working.

237
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,774
We stole a car. Are you serious?
What's happening?

238
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,484
Oh, we stole a car.
Uh, we gotta go.

239
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,286
We did not steal a car, Cam.
It was given to us.

240
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,865
Why are you giving me attitude?
You're the one that stole a car!

241
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,792
How is this a stolen car? How?

242
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,290
I don't know! I'm confused!
Do you have an aspirin?

243
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,293
This isn't my car!

244
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,836
Mmm. Mm-mmm.

245
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,503
Mmm. Hey, Lukey.

246
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,633
Hi. What's goin' on?

247
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,306
Oh, I don't have-
I'll check.

248
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,513
I have it.

249
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:37,937
Well, I could bring it by and
meet you outside in 20 minutes.

250
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,764
No, sweet-
Out-Outside, sweetie.

251
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,191
Okay. Bye-We-

252
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:44,145
Do you mind swinging by
my kid's sleepover?

253
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,776
I gotta give him his retainer.
It's on the way to the club.

254
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,991
Sure. No problem.
Oh, you are so sweet.

255
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:53,286
Holy pythons, Batman!
Do you ever leave the gym?

256
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,455
Uh, no. Actually, I'm a
trainer and a masseur.

257
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,328
Oh, my God.

258
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,125
I'm gonna have to try out
that second one.

259
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,168
Zip, please.

260
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,963
I gotta say, this night
is turning out to be ...

261
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,540
a lot more fun
than I expected.

262
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:09,048
I've got two kids at sleepovers
and one upstate with Daddy.

263
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,596
The fun is just beginning.

264
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,514
Unbelievable.

265
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,396
The valet gave our car away to
someone, like, an hour and a half ago.

266
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,942
You know what that means.

267
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:29,360
Our pot pies could be anywhere by now.
They probably went home.

268
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:32,363
If we knew their address, maybe we
could see if our car was there.

269
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,319
Oh, yeah, and how do you propose
we do that?

270
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,246
Calculating route home.

271
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:40,542
Oh, you're good. Oh, and look.
Only .6 miles away.

272
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:43,962
Prepare to turn night
in 500 feel.

273
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,665
Notice how she didn't wait until
a?er the turn to tell me, Cam?

274
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,042
Really? This? Now?
I'm just-

275
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,004
Oh, look, they went to see Jay-Z. We
almost went to see Jay-Z, didn't we?

276
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,009
No, no, no. 'Cause, remember?
It started at 8:30.

277
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,136
Oh, yeah, which meant he wouldn't
have gone on till 10:00.

278
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,935
- And that's a parking nightmare.
- Oh, and those stairs.

279
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,304
Okay,
I'm hearing it now.

280
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,139
Is Claire right?
Are we in a rut?

281
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,317
Oh, we might be, especially
compared to these people.

282
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,519
Look at this.
Cancún luggage tickets.

283
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,570
A parking pass to Yosemite.

284
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:12,195
A triathlon bib.
This is living.

285
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,571
No, but, you know,
we have Lily, okay?

286
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,491
You can't do that with a child.
They have a car seat.

287
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,077
Okay, fine, we're in a rut.

288
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,284
Destination ahead
in 900 feet.

289
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,211
You know, maybe we just need to be
around more stimulating people.

290
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,084
Well, we're gonna be
in about 900 feet.

291
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,461
It's not the craziest idea.
They seem like fun people.

292
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,918
Yeah, and maybe we can be new couples
friends with them, you know?

293
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:35,972
We can go out to concerts, try exciting
new food, maybe do some luxury camping.

294
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:40,052
Hitch our wagon to their star and see
how fast they spice up our life.

295
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,053
You have arrived.
I believe we have.

296
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,853
You dumb son of a bitch!

297
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,400
Oh, my God, what's happening?

298
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,019
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
What's happening?

299
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,979
I can't believe
you came back here,

300
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,822
you filthy, cheating pig!
No, no, back up.

301
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:56,151
- Back up, I said!
- I'm trying! We are in a rut.

302
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:57,907
Really? You want to talk
about that right now?

303
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,325
No, we are stuck.
We're in an actual rut.

304
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:03,079
We're stuck.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

305
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,043
We are victim of a hate crime right now.
Go! Go! Oh, my God.

306
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,340
Oh, no, you don't. Dad!
What are you doing here?

307
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,007
What's this, buddy?
Ginger ale.

308
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,589
Oh, really?
Cause it smells-

309
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,549
Okay, it smells like ginger ale,
but that doesn't prove anything.

310
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,259
What the hell?
We are leaving.

311
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,307
I'm having a nice time!
With this clown?

312
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:27,058
And by the way, it's a little cliche to pick
someone who looks exactly like your dad.

313
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,983
I got your number, Pi Chi.

314
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,194
I know you.
Yeah, you do.

315
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,988
This is Ben Ford. He's in my class.
He's visiting too.

316
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,690
You were my T-ball coach.

317
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,743
My dad's your doctor.
He's right over there.

318
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,492
What is wrong with you?

319
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:44,074
Are you trying to ruin college
for me before I even get here?

320
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,875
No, I'm not.
I am so sorry.

321
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,874
You are not a clown. You are
an excellent backup shortstop.

322
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,920
Alecia, Bruce.
Go Bullfrogs- Dogs!

323
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,593
Go Bulldogs. Claire!

324
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,796
Wow. Really.

325
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,890
No, it's just a shock, is all.
Jay.

326
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,468
So Celia is carrying
the judge's baby.

327
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,770
No wonder she shot him.
She's hormonal.

328
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,472
- Who are you talking to?
- The housekeeper.

329
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,307
Maria, I've gotta go.

330
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,858
Thanks a lot.

331
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,857
- Jay, I need you to talk to Manny.
- What?

332
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,236
If he's doing what you think he's
doing, then he needs to talk to a man.

333
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:19,158
I don't want him
to be ashamed of anything.

334
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,279
Then you don't want to send me in there.
But what if he has questions?

335
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,950
What if he doesn't know how-
Gloria-

336
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,455
Gloria, whatever he's going through,
he can work it out himself.

337
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,206
Help! I'm stuck!

338
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,289
Ay, no. Jay, go! I beg of
you, go, go, go! Gloria-

339
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,750
I'm extremely reluctant
to do this.

340
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,379
Please hurry!

341
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,336
Ay, no. I cannot look at this.

342
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:41,681
What the hell?
I can't get down, Jay!

343
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,516
What? What
happened to Manny?

344
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,435
Ay, somebody
say something to me!

345
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:47,888
Gloria, it's okay.

346
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,480
Come in.
Okay.

347
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,734
- He was hanging from that bar up there.
- What? Why?

348
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,483
What do you have on your head?

349
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,235
It's a weighted helmet to
stretch me so I can get taller.

350
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:02,077
Whoa! Manny, why do you
have to get tall now?

351
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,903
Love, Mom. Why else?

352
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:07,957
I lost Bella to Durkas because,
in her words, "He's tall."

353
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,705
Everybody else
is getting taller but me.

354
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:12,295
You think it's the coffee? No.

355
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:16,170
Maybe, but- But hanging downside
up is not gonna help you.

356
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,251
The Web site said it would.

357
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:23,340
Listen, Manny, you're already
intelligent and beautiful and funny.

358
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,768
If you get tall, you're
going to have everything,

359
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:30,598
and those poor boys are not gonna
have anything to compete with you.

360
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,432
Look at this.

361
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,734
You have a mark
in your head now.

362
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,527
I'm gonna go get you
some ice, okay?

363
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,365
That's a lot of pretty words,
but they don't help me tomorrow.

364
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,113
Sorry, kid.
Just one of those things.

365
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,785
You get taller
when you get taller.

366
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,784
Why don't you
get ready for bed?

367
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,208
Ah, geez.

368
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:58,838
You know, when I was your age, I
started workin' out to get the girls.

369
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,964
- You think that would help?
- Yeah.

370
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,262
So tomorrow,
we start workin' out.

371
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,839
Okay?

372
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:08,927
Maybe I'll even show you a few pull-ups
on, uh, this bad boy here, huh?

373
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,150
You see that?

374
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,604
Pretty soon, that's how strong
you're gonna be.

375
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,491
Thanks, Mom. Shh! I don't
want them to know I was here.

376
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,239
Okay. Oh, Claire, I
thought that was you.

377
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,740
Thank God. Come in.

378
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,197
I can't, 'cause I'm sick, remember?
Sorry.

379
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,999
My DVD playerjust broke, and none of
us know how Gone with the Wind ends.

380
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,667
- But you saw it, right?
- Is that Claire?

381
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,495
- Yeah.
- Can you tell us what happened?

382
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,797
Uh, I could, but I don't want
to ruin it for you.

383
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,712
Claire, just tell us.
Just tell us.

384
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,043
Come on.
Um-

385
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:47,508
Scarlett is really mad
at Clark Gable because, um,

386
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,467
he's done just so-
so many bad things.

387
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,929
And didn't he, um, burn down
a farm or something?

388
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,185
Claire, have you been drinking?

389
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,813
Um, I had a hot toddy.

390
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,360
Made one for my throat, so-

391
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,109
Pretty dressed up
for a night in bed, right?

392
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,816
Yeah, I-l just threw on the first
thing I could find when Luke called.

393
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:07,368
- It was just right there on the chair.
- She has a stamp on her hand.

394
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,993
Okay. All right. Before we bust out
the pitchforks and the torches,

395
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:13,996
may I remind you that I've driven
every one of your children home,

396
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,668
and heimliched
at least one, Bethenny.

397
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,378
Hi.  Hello.

398
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,797
This is totally inappropriate,
but could I use your bathroom?

399
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,340
Sorry.
You kept pushing the drinks.

400
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,009
It's- Friend.
Gay friend. Gay.

401
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,128
I'm not gay.
Yes, you are.

402
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,385
I'm not gay. I'm-I'm French.
You thought I was gay?

403
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,137
Are you serious right now?

404
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,184
Are you? You've been throwing
yourself at me all night.

405
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,262
N-No. No. I have not.

406
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,814
- Bethenny, grab the Pinot.
- Bethenny, do not grab the Pinot.

407
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:40,359
You undressed in front of me.
You squeezed my arm.

408
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,186
You asked me for a massage.
What was all that?

409
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:46,275
That was- That was me safely
objectifying a gay person.

410
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,030
Wow, Claire.

411
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:51,363
When I wrote "Don't ever change" in your
yearbook, I didn't mean it like this.

412
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,243
Oh, ease up, Holly.

413
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,201
Okay, I lied. I lied.

414
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,707
But I get one night to myself,

415
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:02,632
and I just wanted to spend it
with some fun gay people.

416
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,550
It's not my fault this one
decided to be straight.

417
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,170
I've always been straight.
Oh, you don't get to talk!

418
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,597
I took fashion advice
from you.

419
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,891
Oh, my God, do I even
look good in this dress?

420
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,264
No, not you.

421
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,812
- It's really short, isn't it?
- it's short.

422
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,389
Yeah.

423
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,940
Please! Please just listen
to me for one second.

424
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,817
Go away!
Stop following me.

425
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,943
Hey, you want to tell me why
you're bothering this younglady?

426
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,401
Oh, no, no, no, no, Officer.
This is my daughter. Tell him.

427
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,950
Tonight, I don't know who you are.
She's-She's joking.

428
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,372
I'm not dangerous.

429
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,495
In fact, I helped to put
all the lights on this path.

430
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:39,794
Twenty years ago, some friends
and I took back the night, so-

431
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:43,294
I think I just-
I embarrassed her a little.

432
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,717
A little? That sweatshirt
embarrasses me a little.

433
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,879
Yep, that's a daughter.

434
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,886
Tonight was insane. Why did
you have to act like that?

435
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,764
You were at that party. I see
you talking to frat boys, and-

436
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,972
isn't that why we're here?
So I can experience college?

437
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:01,399
I mean, what are you gonna
do when I actually go?

438
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,603
I don't know.
Freak out, I think.

439
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,107
Look.

440
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:14,154
Your whole life,
my job's been to protect you.

441
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:17,035
A job I kind of love.

442
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,287
And I feel like I'm being forced
into early retirement.

443
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,255
I just needed to find you
and make sure you were okay-

444
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,376
for as long
as I still get to do that.

445
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,589
It's just like you-

446
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,142
Piss me off,
then say something sweet.

447
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,271
I'm not leaving
until the fall.

448
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:44,101
Maybe by then I can figure out how
to put a force field around you.

449
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:48,150
I've been working on that one
since the first time ...

450
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:51,028
I tried to fasten you
into your car seat.

451
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,656
I pinched
your chunky little thigh.

452
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:56,738
Aw.

453
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:00,993
Even though you basically
just called me fat.

454
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,215
So, is it really fun?

455
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,792
What?

456
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,717
No.

457
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,019
We all struggle
with limitations.

458
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:22,062
Some we're willing to accept-

459
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:26,393
You know, I just want to be home,
reading on opposite ends of the sofa.

460
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:29,862
And some we're not. I'm
so embarrassed I did that.

461
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,156
I'm just so happy
that that was all it was.

462
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,279
Why? What'd you think
I was doing?

463
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:36,990
It's never too late
to grow in life.

464
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:40,536
Oh, my God!

465
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,163
"Thanks to our patented
Lengthenator,

466
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,212
you can increase your height
by up to four inches."

467
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:49,753
I cannot believe he spent
$50 in this thing. I know.

468
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:52,631
He could've got a two-year
subscription to Playboy for that.

469
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,801
He's not getting the Playboy ever!
Ow!

470
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,382
He's a little boy!

471
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,429
Wouldn't it be great
if we woke up tomorrow,

472
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,105
and our car had
found its way home?

473
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,774
I feel that's not the way
it's gonna happen.

474
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:08,351
Happened on the farm one time.

475
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:11,108
A tornado scooped up one of our
calves, dropped it who knows where.

476
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:14,737
Six months later, a full-grown cow
comes walking up the driveway.

477
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,067
Same markings, same moo.

478
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,035
That night, we- We ate like kings.
Yeah.

479
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,112
Okay, I've told it before.

480
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,869
Oh, my gosh, it's our car!

481
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,872
I see you've met my wife.

482
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,459
