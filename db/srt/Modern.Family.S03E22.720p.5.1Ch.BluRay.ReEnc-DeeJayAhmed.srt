1
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:04,804
Please, please, please.
Okay, what is this?

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,133
We're making sure I'm tall enough
to ride all the rides at Disneyland ...

3
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:08,684
without having
to spike up my hair.

4
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:11,308
Buddy,
we are good to go.

5
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,138
- Sweet!
- I have been waiting for this day ...

6
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:17,022
ever since the doctor pointed to the ultrasound
of your mom's womb and said,

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,977
"Either that's a fifth limb"-

8
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:20,529
Okay, no. Gross.

9
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:22,982
All right. I want everybody
to eat a lot at home ...

10
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:25,033
because
The Happiest Place on Earth ...

11
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,486
is also home to the most
expensive churro on earth.

12
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:31,540
Come on. This is gonna be awesome.
Who doesn't love a day at Disneyland?

13
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:33,242
Can't you and Mom
go without me?

14
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:35,623
You're the kid.
I think we need you to get in.

15
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,295
Well, it couldn't come
on a worse day.

16
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,089
The technology sector
is tanking.

17
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:42,543
We're doing a stock market project
in school, and today's the last day.

18
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:44,879
We all get a thousand
fake dollars to invest,

19
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,635
and as of
market close yesterday,

20
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,386
I'm in the lead.

21
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,888
I may not be the tallest
or the most athletic,

22
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:52,891
but someday
I will be the richest.

23
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,143
Which is good,
because the ladies love that.

24
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:58,146
And I've grown accustomed
to a certain lifestyle.

25
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,478
Do you really want girls
who only want you for your money?

26
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,780
I'd like
to have that option.

27
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:06,279
Manny, put the stock away
and put your ears on.

28
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,531
Mom, I don't think
you have to wear one of these.

29
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,362
Be a kid! Put them on!

30
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,491
Really? Those shoes? What?

31
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:16,623
Do you know how much walking
you have to do at Disneyland?

32
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:19,171
Why do you think they have
so many fat people on scooters?

33
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,340
I like wearing the high heels.
I'm fine.

34
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:25,045
This is just like that jacket you refuse
to bring when I say, "Take a jacket."

35
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:27,221
"Don't tell me what to do! I'm fine!"

36
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,549
Huh? And you're not fine.
You're cold and shivering,

37
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,225
and I look like the jerk
who won't give his wife a jacket.

38
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:34,099
So I do.
And then I'm cold and shivering,

39
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,679
and I brought a jacket.

40
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,390
Are you done with
your boring jacket story?

41
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:39,975
Because we're going
to hit traffic.

42
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:43,437
I'll tell you one thing.
I'm not gonna give you my shoes.

43
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,524
Ah! That must be Ethan.

44
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,655
Who's Ethan?
Didn't I tell you?

45
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:51,157
My friend Bethenny's nephew
is coming with us today.

46
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,113
He moved to town
to go to college.

47
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,949
He's very nice, very smart-
big hockey player.

48
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,748
I know what you're doing.
Really? She was so subtle.

49
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:02,877
Haley has a thing for bad boys,
which was so me.

50
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,799
Clearly.

51
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,298
So, if she's going to be
leaving the nest soon,

52
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,345
we'd prefer it was not
on the back of a motorcycle.

53
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:12,137
My college roommate had
a motorcycle. Mmm.

54
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,889
Man, I had some good times
on the back of that thing.

55
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,934
Can't believe you did this.
I'm not gonna babysit Bethenny's nephew.

56
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,479
Alex can have him. Okay, I
don't need your rejects.

57
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,352
Hi, Ethan!
Hi.

58
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,730
I'm so glad you could make it.
Thanks for inviting me.

59
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,856
Sure.
Hi. I'm Al-

60
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,362
My 14-year-old sister.
Ethan, was it?

61
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:33,036
- Yeah.
- Oh.

62
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,656
# Hey, hey #

63
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,741
# Hey, hey #

64
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,792
# Hey, hey #

65
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,666
# Hey, hey #

66
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:42,917
# Hey ##

67
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,801
And that's my grandpa
and his wife, Gloria,

68
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,344
and her son, Manny.

69
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,012
Wow. You guys have
a big family.

70
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,511
Big family.

71
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,142
She likes him!
Yeah, who wouldn't?

72
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:57,891
Where'd you find him,
a Tommy Hilfiger catalog?

73
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,855
He got a 2200 on his S.A.T.'s.

74
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,399
And those eyes.

75
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,147
Okay. Did you get him
for Haley or for you?

76
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:05,694
Mitchell.

77
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,067
You know, I haven't been here
since Dad brought us when we were kids.

78
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,773
Oh, yeah. Remember?

79
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,858
You cried in
the Abraham Lincoln thing.

80
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:15,992
Hey, he was a great president,
and it was the first robot I ever saw.

81
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:19,993
When Claire and Mitchell were young, their mom
and I were gonna take them to Disneyland.

82
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:23,295
But that morning, Dede and I got in
this huge fight over something or other-

83
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,872
surprise, surprise-

84
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,583
and I ended up
taking them on my own.

85
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,465
Claire's biggest fear
was running into the evil queen.

86
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,764
My biggest fear
was that I married her.

87
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:38,265
Okay, people over 46 inches,
first stop- Indiana Jones!

88
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,138
- Have fun on the teacups, Lily.
- Okay, let's do this.

89
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,815
Oh, okay, wait.
Just a second here, everybody.

90
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,151
All right.

91
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,563
Is that a leash?
No, it's a child safety tether.

92
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,148
This way, sweetie.

93
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,950
It- it's a leash.
Don't- Don't judge us.

94
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,323
Go on.

95
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:58,868
We have a runner. Lily is
going through a phase-

96
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,868
At least- Oh, we hope it's a phase.
She bolts every chance she gets.

97
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:03,748
Lily.

98
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,454
Lily!

99
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,335
Lily!

100
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,042
So we had no choice but to put her
on a child safety tether.

101
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,593
It's a leash.

102
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,012
And we did have a choice.

103
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,557
Lily, sweetie, don't pull.

104
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,768
Lily, heel! Dad.

105
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,437
If I'd have known you guys were gonna
do this, I'd have brought Stella.

106
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,431
It was Cam's idea. So much
for the united front.

107
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,937
I'll have you know,
despite all yourjokes, Lily enjoys it.

108
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,858
Okay, sweetie.
You're not helping.

109
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,938
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
You guys- Is that Dylan?

110
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,569
What?  Aw, geez.

111
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,284
Dylan? Oh. Hey!

112
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,158
Uh, what are you-
I didn't even know you were in town.

113
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:42,081
Either did I ...
know you were in town.

114
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,659
This town. Anaheim.

115
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,619
I thought you were
still in Wyoming.

116
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:49,377
I was, uh,
but, um-

117
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,879
Oh, shoot. You know, I, uh,
gotta meet up with some friends,

118
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,676
and I'm ...
really late.

119
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,472
It was nice to see you, Haley,
and everybody.

120
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,015
Hi.

121
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,764
- And dude I don't know.
- I'm Ethan. it's nice to meet you.

122
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,937
And polite dude
I don't know.

123
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,022
Did Haley used to date
that guy or something?

124
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:13,150
Yep. You date her,
that's the club you're joining.

125
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,653
Of course he would
still look amazing.

126
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,860
Does he? I hadn't noticed.

127
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:20,742
Did you know
that Ethan plays the trumpet?

128
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,745
No great surprise
with those lips of his, huh?

129
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,623
Coo-coo-ca-choo,
Mrs. Robinson.

130
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,703
Okay, buddy,
moment of truth.

131
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,541
Yes! Whoo!
Yes!

132
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,886
This is gonna be so awesome!
Yeah!

133
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,509
In 45 minutes,
this is gonna be so awesome!

134
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,435
Yeah!

135
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,021
Look, Reuben, I have
some underperformers I have to unload,

136
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,148
and I don't have access
to a computer.

137
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,946
Log in as "Money Delgado."
Manny!

138
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,649
By all means, Reuben,
go get a Popsicle while the Nikkei closes.

139
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,447
I want to be a pauper.
Come on.

140
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,403
Mom,
my stocks just took a dive.

141
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,659
Your phone is about
to take a dive.

142
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,365
Come on!
Where do we want to go next?

143
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,576
Oh! Ethan and I want to try
the Haunted Mansion.

144
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,161
There is no
"you and Ethan."

145
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:11,292
Let's go to the Jungle Cruise.
It's right there.

146
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,998
Why? Tired of walking
in those heels?

147
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:16,176
No. You tired of being
with a hot wife?

148
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:21,845
Well, well, well. What do you know? Another
caring parent with a child safety tether.

149
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,550
See? We're not
the only people who use them.

150
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:26,394
Hi! Aren't they adorable?
Oh, and look at your cutie!

151
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,312
Oh, well, yes.
She just wanted to say hi.

152
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,106
Oh. Sorry.
They're a little feisty today.

153
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:33,060
- Oh! No problem. She's friendly.
- Oh. Rex, gentle.

154
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,566
- Oh. His name's Rex, huh?
- Yeah.

155
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,522
Okay. Lily. No, sweetie-
Lily, um-

156
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,820
Sorry. He just gets excited.
Oh, yeah, no- Oh, no problem.

157
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,823
Lily, stop moving, sweetie.
Stop moving.

158
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,867
Okay, you got this. Okay. Okay, good girl!
Good girl! Sorry.

159
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,252
You know what the fight
with Dede was about?

160
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:53,922
I taped a football game
over an episode of Dallas.

161
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:58,002
Who bails on a family trip to Disneyland
over something like that?

162
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,712
Ironically, Dallas
was playing in the game.

163
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,014
And I remember
pointing that out to her,

164
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,218
and then I remember
a videocassette flying at my head.

165
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:09,563
You do not' play the cello. I do.
Even geekier- I'm good.

166
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,353
Okay, answer me this-
I will answer you this.

167
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,685
Why do people
carry cellos around?

168
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,021
You know, people aren't expected
to lug a piano around.

169
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,613
What's the cutoff?
I know, right?

170
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,612
Like, go where the cello is.

171
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:26,447
Oh, look at this. I think I've inadvertently
set up my 14-year-old with a college boy.

172
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,073
The boy was your doing?
Yes.

173
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:31,330
Yes, and he was perfect,
and Haley was into him,

174
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,036
until, of course,
we ran into Dylan.

175
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,247
I mean, come on, Dad.
What are the odds of that happening?

176
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,874
It's a small world.
Yes, it is.

177
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,501
See what I did there? It's a ride.
I did. Got it. I got it.

178
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:42,838
It's just so frustrating because
I know I can't run Haley's life for her,

179
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:46,016
but if she would let me,
I would be so good at it.

180
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:49,015
Right, 'cause parents
always know what's best for their kids.

181
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,813
You remember that nice girl at the office
I tried to fix Mitch up with?

182
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,390
No offense, Dad,
but I think ...

183
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,477
I probably have a better sense
of what my kids need than you did.

184
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,195
I think it's cute you think that.
Oh.

185
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,524
Mom!
It was so awesome!

186
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:06,157
The jeep was jerking around, and- and there
was a lot of sharp turns and big drops.

187
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,745
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
It just kept going.

188
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,991
Wow. You okay? Great.
Why wouldn't I be?

189
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:14,620
Because you're kind of leaning on me.
isn't that what a marriage is?

190
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,956
Oh, Alex,
stop touching him.

191
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,333
You look like hell.

192
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,963
Feel a little dizzy.

193
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,510
I think that ride
did something to me.

194
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,178
Fluid in your inner ear
is thickening.

195
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,138
That's what happens when you get old.
It is?

196
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,182
Yeah,
you can't take the motion.

197
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,681
I gotta pop a Dramamine
to get in my swivel chair.

198
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,809
That is not it.
I'm king of the roller coasters.

199
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,230
I think I just put too big of a whipped
cream smile on my pancake this morning.

200
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,854
You guys wanna go on Matterhorn? Luke, I think
me and your dad are gonna sit this one out,

201
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,439
maybe get one of them
big pickles.

202
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,492
No! You're gonna have to eat
that pickle on your own, Jay.

203
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,490
I still got
a few good years left.

204
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:50,448
Luke, wait up!
I'll race you there!

205
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,618
I'm good. I'm good.

206
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,670
Okay, everybody's looking at us.

207
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,090
I haven't been judged by this many people
since I forgot my canvas bags at Whole Foods.

208
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,388
Yeah. Well, maybe they're staring
because we have what they want.

209
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,636
Wh- Oh, a pet daughter.
Is that-

210
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,217
You know, I don't care
what people think.

211
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,768
If I thought it would
keep my daughter safe,

212
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,641
I would have a kangaroo pouch
sewn into my midriff.

213
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,564
That's gonna work out
really well for you as a single parent.

214
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,767
Okay, we just got a glare
from Mr. Socks-With-Sandals.

215
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,318
All right. That's it.

216
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,779
Lily, I'm gonna take off this leash.
I think it's a mistake.

217
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:25,528
But I don't want you to run away,
'cause that would be very, very unsafe.

218
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:30,078
And if we lost you, you'd be very scared,
and we'd be very sad, okay?

219
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,663
Okay.
All right.

220
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:35,163
See, Cam? You treat her
like a human being, and she acts like one.

221
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,538
Chip 'n' Dale!

222
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:39,337
Oh, great.
Now she's chasing squirrels. Lily!

223
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,877
Honey, come on!
Lily! Lily!

224
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:50,591
- Hey, how was Splash Mountain?
- It was great. Maybe we go again.

225
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,675
No, thanks.
There was no reception in there.

226
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,853
You know how many bars I had?
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah.

227
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,930
Reuben, talk to me!

228
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,937
Must be nice to
get out of those shoes for a minute.

229
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,814
I don't know what
you're talking about.

230
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,486
Nothing. I'm just
making conversation.

231
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,563
Hey. Check it out.

232
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:10,403
I bought one of those souvenir photos
with you and Manny on the ride.

233
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,533
Boy, it looks like
you're having a good time.

234
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,614
Wait a minute.
What's that in your hand?

235
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,199
Are those shoes?

236
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,034
I'm not even sure
that that is us, Jay.

237
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,665
Why are you
walking around in pain?

238
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,917
Just admit the shoes
were a bad idea.

239
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,589
I am not in pain.

240
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:27,260
I just didn't want my favorite
walking shoes to get wet there.

241
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,053
Okay. My bad.

242
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,674
Well, we've gotta meet everybody in
Tomorrowland, so we'd better get movin',

243
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,805
'cause it's all the way
on the other side of the park.

244
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,386
I'm fine.

245
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,892
You just try
to keep up with us.

246
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:42,522
I can't take this.

247
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,905
Dad, throw your hands up! it's fun!

248
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,948
Oh, yeah, it is fun!

249
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,033
Hey! Yeah!

250
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,110
Whoo!
Hey.

251
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:56,448
Whoa! Whoo!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

252
00:10:56,531 --> 00:11:01,162
Reuben, if you heard about that stock
at a birthday party, it's already too late.

253
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:02,996
Gloria!

254
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,547
Gloria,
sit down for a second.

255
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,042
I'm fine, Jay.
Please?

256
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,421
Look, you may not be in pain.
Okay.

257
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,631
But I'm in pain
just thinking you're in pain.

258
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:16,510
So humor me for one minute.
What are those?

259
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:20,097
There wasn't a big selection
at the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique.

260
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,682
Are you crazy?

261
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:25,735
I cannot walk around in public
with these ... things.

262
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,063
They're so yellow
and so ugly.

263
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:32,401
And- And they're so softy
and so comfortable.

264
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,110
Jay, what is this?

265
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,034
Thank you for
going shopping for me.

266
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,366
Thank you for worrying
about my feet.

267
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:43,044
Thank you for giving me
your jacket when I'm cold.

268
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,668
Such a good man, Jay.
Thank you.

269
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:46,873
Mmm.

270
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,001
Wow.

271
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,883
I didn't expect you
to be so-

272
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:53,963
so nice.

273
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:57,051
Why are you so surprised?

274
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,808
Now, please, don't go
all Latin on me when I say this.

275
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:05,814
Is it possible you get angry,
from time to time,

276
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,145
because you're
always wearing ...

277
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,151
uncomfortable shoes?

278
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,160
Maybe.

279
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,330
Can you get me
a couple of more?

280
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,495
Maybe they have purple?
Whatever you want, honey.

281
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:27,081
All I'm saying is, it seemed like you were
pretty into Ethan until Dylan showed up.

282
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:30,007
Don't get me wrong.
Ethan's nice, but he's no Dylan.

283
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,585
Maybe that's a good thing?

284
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,591
Why? Because Dylan's
a free spirit?

285
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,049
He's too edgy for you?
He plays by his own rules?

286
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,301
Oh, my God.
What?

287
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:43,981
I beg of you to turn around and experience
with me the greatest moment of my life.

288
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:49,607
# Daisy, Daisy
You're the one I adore #

289
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,859
Your rebel boyfriends
a Dapper Dan.

290
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,950
Maybe that's not him.
# I want to be with you more #

291
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:58,320
Oh! 3 It won't be a stylish- #

292
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,368
Dylan! Uh- Uh, sorry.
Sorry.

293
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,700
Certainly seems like him.

294
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,456
Oh, my God. He looked like those
old pictures of Dad from high school.

295
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:10,961
Mm-hmm.

296
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,508
I'm really into street art
at the moment.

297
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,335
There's a really great exhibit downtown.
I'll take you.

298
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,306
Oh, on what, your Razor scooter?
Mom wants you. Uh- Uh-

299
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:21,225
Ethan, I've been looking all over for you!

300
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,311
I remember I was on
Pirates of the Caribbean,

301
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,143
and this whole fight with Dede
was really eating at me.

302
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,696
And there was this angry animatronic
wench with a rolling pin ...

303
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,364
chasing some poor
pirate around.

304
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,034
They were on a track,
running in circles,

305
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,328
so he could never
get away from her.

306
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:42,121
And I remember thinking,

307
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,699
"I can't save you, buddy,

308
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,784
but I'm getting
off this ride."

309
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,291
A-And we-
A-And we were going around a corner,

310
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,839
and I was screaming,
and I swallowed a bug!

311
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,212
Oh, being tall is everything
that I dreamed it would be.

312
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,462
What should we do next?
Sit down.

313
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,806
Where we gonna sit down? The ground.
Here. This is good. Right here.

314
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,424
Oh!
Are you okay, Dad?

315
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,851
No, I'm not okay.

316
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,645
I hate to say this,
but these rides are killing me.

317
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,937
But you're the king of
roller coasters. I know!

318
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,394
Something happens
when you get older.

319
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:15,196
Guess you can't take it.

320
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:19,367
One of my favorite things in the world
is doing stupid fun stuff with you,

321
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:22,742
like pogo-stick basketball or trying
to get a swing to go all the way around.

322
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,323
Next time, we should sit
on a fire extinguisher.

323
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:28,167
Yes, or a bottle of Coke
and some Mentos. Ah.

324
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,540
Honestly, though,
the way I'm feeling right now,

325
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,588
I don't know if there's
gonna be a next time.

326
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:36,634
Dad, we can always
find cool stuff to do.

327
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,053
Even if you're old
and in a wheelchair,

328
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,802
I'll take you to the mall and push you
as fast as you wanna go.

329
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,304
Really? You'd do that?

330
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,853
Heck, yeah.
And we'll pop some wheelies too.

331
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:50,564
That sounds fun. And I'll take you to
the top of a huge hill and just let go.

332
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,645
Okay, we'll nail down the specifics later,
but that- that's really nice.

333
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:57,939
So, do you still
wanna talk or-

334
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,487
No, go. Ride Space Mountain.

335
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,694
Hey. Hey, uh, at the end,
when they take a picture,

336
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,404
do something hilarious
for both of us.

337
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,114
You're gonna die.

338
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,038
When you see it, not
'cause you're old. Yup.

339
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,915
Whoo!

340
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,246
Lily! Lily, stop!

341
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,501
Dad! Dad, grab her!

342
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,296
Hey! I got ya, you little monkey!
Thank you.

343
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,003
Hey, Cam, I got her.
We're in Fantasyland. Where are you?

344
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,173
Okay, it's Toontown,
not "Toonton."

345
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,054
You've been watching
too much PBS.

346
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,852
Thank you.
All right, honey. Come here.

347
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,604
I don't like this thing.
Yeah?

348
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:35,561
Well, I don't like running like a crazy person
through Downton- Downtown Disney.

349
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:38,234
I don't know what to do.
The leash is not the answer.

350
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,064
- You want my help?
- Yes, please!

351
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,071
'Cause I can fix this for you
in about two minutes.

352
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,869
Come on, baby girl.
Come with me. We'll be right back.

353
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,535
Okay. Where we going?
Oh, this way?

354
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:51,955
Ugh!

355
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:55,664
Manny, you don't sound very happy
for a kid that is flying an elephant.

356
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,090
I lost to Durkas.
It's not fair.

357
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,794
He wanted to buy IBM
because he thought it was funny to say.

358
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:04,347
Well, I'm glad that you lost.
Fake money has changed you.

359
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:07,972
Where is the Manny that used to stop
to smell the roses?

360
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,144
He took a bath on
a solar start-up in San Jose.

361
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,598
You have been so busy burying
your face in your phone ...

362
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,979
that you barely said hello
to your family,

363
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,652
you gave Winnie-the-Pooh
the cold shoulder ...

364
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:22,073
and you haven't even noticed
that pretty girl in the blue elephant ...

365
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,946
that has been smiling at you.

366
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,954
Not my type.
But still, nice to be noticed.

367
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:31,329
You see what happens when you're not
burying your head in business?

368
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,535
You're right.
I'll try to be more present.

369
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:39,332
What the heck's on your feet?
They're slippers.

370
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,884
They're like pillows.

371
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,803
Attagirl.

372
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,632
You're welcome.

373
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,183
Look. Your dad
got her baby high heels,

374
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,010
which we said we were never
gonna let her wear.

375
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,266
- I love 'em.
- You look gorgeous, sweetie.

376
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,939
Oh, my God.
You thought people judged us before?

377
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:57,309
Wait till they meet Little Miss Anaheim.
Who cares? Look at her.

378
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,018
She can barely move.

379
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,354
Thank you, Dad.

380
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,281
You know what? She's got
pretty good garns for a 3-year-old.

381
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,403
Cheese!

382
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:11,372
Got it. Thanks, Little John.
Thank you.

383
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,371
Aw.
Oh! They have corn dogs.

384
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,418
We gotta get one before we go back.
They are legendary.

385
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,538
I'll be right back.
Okay.

386
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:22,046
Haley!
It's me, Dylan.

387
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,798
I'm in the bear suit.
I borrowed it to talk to you.

388
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,754
Why are you
dancing like that?

389
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,760
This is what
Little John does.

390
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,887
Maybe. I don't know what movie
this dude is from.

391
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,685
I'm not even supposed
to be talking to you.

392
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,512
Well,
I'm not talking to you.

393
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,723
No, you can talk.

394
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,729
I know. But I'm mad.

395
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,731
You came back to town
and didn't even call me.

396
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,562
I was embarrassed.

397
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:46,821
I lost my job at the dude ranch,
and I wanted to get my act together first.

398
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,776
What, the
four-dweebs-on-a-bike act?

399
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:53,205
Okay, the Dapper Dans are
a Main Street tradition since 1959.

400
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,783
Hey. What's going on?

401
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:56,875
Nothing.

402
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:59,249
I still love her,
Ethan.

403
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,668
Okay, how do you know my name?
it's Dylan.

404
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,170
Look, I don't wanna
harsh your day,

405
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,971
but I've never stopped loving Haley,
and I never will!

406
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,672
I-Is this
some sort of joke?

407
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,725
- Do I look like I'm joking?
- Dylan, let's not do this now.

408
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,929
It has to be now.
I've got a parade at 3:00.

409
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,480
Hey, seriously, dude,
back off.

410
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:20,274
Okay. That was my face.

411
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,693
And you're the one
who needs to back off.

412
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,815
Oh!
Oh. Ho! You-

413
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:30,447
Okay. This thing's kinda heavy.
I can't get up.

414
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,871
Ethan? Ethan, what is going on?
What are you doing?

415
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,823
Uh, hi, Mrs. Dunphy.
Help me up.

416
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,034
Oh. No.

417
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,543
If I could get up, I would-

418
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:47,673
Come on, Lily, sweetie.
Keep up, honey. Come on.

419
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:50,471
Phil, you don't look like
you're doing very well.

420
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,846
Maybe because I officially became an old
man back there at Thunder Mountain.

421
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:58,054
Oh. Oh, my goodness. You are burning up.
You might have the flu.

422
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:04,603
A bunch of guys at work had the flu, and we all
drink orange juice out of the same carton.

423
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:07,071
We should get cups.
Hmm.

424
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,695
Luke, did you hear that?
I have the flu!

425
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,367
Glad we didn't
share that pickle.

426
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:13,865
Hey, everybody.

427
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,537
Oh, hey- Hey, guys.
Where's Ethan?

428
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,411
Oh, he's staying.
He ran into some friends.

429
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,164
But Dylan got fired, so-
Don't freak out.

430
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,495
We have to give him
a ride home.

431
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,580
And we're back together.
Yay.

432
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:29,010
Hey, no one goes home
till we hit the Lincoln thing.

433
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,679
Yawn. Don't even
try to fight it.

434
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,222
Yeah, he made us go
when we were kids.

435
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:37,393
Come on, people. It's a robotic president.
What's not to love?

436
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:38,970
The robotic president?

437
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,852
So my plan was,
drive Claire and Mitchell home,

438
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:46,402
put them to bed,
pour myself a big tumbler of scotch ...

439
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:48,195
and tell Dede it was over.

440
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,523
But on the way out,
we made one last stop.

441
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:54,486
If destruction be our lot,

442
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:59,369
we ourselves must be
its author and finisher.

443
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,918
As a nation of free men,

444
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,416
we must live
through all times-

445
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:09,217
I don't know what happened. Maybe it's what
robot Lincoln said about a man's duty ...

446
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,090
or keeping
the Union together.

447
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,888
Maybe I just chickened out.

448
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:17,342
But I realized
that staying with my kids ...

449
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:20,269
was more impo?ant
than leaving my wife.

450
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,893
Now that's not
the right decision for everyone,

451
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:25,066
but it' was
the right decision for me.

452
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,769
And in that faith,

453
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:29,946
let us, to the end,

454
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,523
dare to do our duty ...

455
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,108
as we understand it.

456
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,660
So I stuck it out
until they were grown.

457
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:40,115
Jay, you want
to join me in the Jacuzzi?

458
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:43,497
And the universe
rewarded me.

459
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,164
Oh, yeah.
Here we go.

460
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,749
Hey, Dad,
roller coaster fist bump.

461
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,384
Whoa!
Whoo!

462
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,214
Whoo!
Whoo!

463
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:59,217
Oh. Oh!

464
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,809
Oh.
What was that?

465
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:03,854
Whoo!

466
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,567
This is gonna be so awesome!
Whoo! Hey!

467
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,565
Close your eyes.
It makes it more fun.

468
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,275
Oh, yeah. That is more fun.

469
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:19,487
Ooh. Oh!

470
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,581
English - US - PSDH
