1
00:00:02,004 --> 00:00:03,255
Hey, sir.

2
00:00:03,338 --> 00:00:05,883
Duane Bailey, running
for town council reelection.

3
00:00:05,966 --> 00:00:08,260
Oh, don't look. There's
that jerk Duane Bailey.

4
00:00:08,343 --> 00:00:09,511
Oh, yuck.

5
00:00:09,595 --> 00:00:11,180
I should say something
to him, shouldn't I?

6
00:00:11,263 --> 00:00:13,348
I gotta be honest. I was
just working off your tone.

7
00:00:13,432 --> 00:00:14,975
Who's Duane Bailey,
and why do we hate him?

8
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:18,437
Honey, he's that councilman who
shot down my stop sign. Big phony.

9
00:00:18,562 --> 00:00:20,147
Yeah. Hey.
Duane Bailey,

10
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,815
seeking reelection,
town council.

11
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:24,026
Hoping I can count on your vote.
Well, you just got it.

12
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:25,068
Phil.

13
00:00:25,152 --> 00:00:27,154
You don't remember
meeting me, do you?

14
00:00:27,237 --> 00:00:30,199
Claire Dunphy. Last month's
town council meeting?

15
00:00:30,282 --> 00:00:33,202
Oh, yes, I do.
Yes, I remember you.

16
00:00:33,285 --> 00:00:35,746
"I want a stop sign."

17
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:38,582
Just having fun.
Here. Have a pen.

18
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:43,378
"Duane Bailey. Councilman.
Citizen. Puggle breeder."

19
00:00:43,462 --> 00:00:46,423
I love them because they're
a different mix of breeds.

20
00:00:46,506 --> 00:00:48,258
Just like America.

21
00:00:48,342 --> 00:00:50,636
- I like what he's saying, Claire.
- He isn't saying anything.

22
00:00:50,761 --> 00:00:53,347
He is. We need a stop
sign at our intersection.

23
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,890
Everyone says that,

24
00:00:54,973 --> 00:00:57,392
but pretty soon, we're stopping
at every single corner.

25
00:00:57,476 --> 00:00:59,686
Why don't you go ask Canada
how that's working out?

26
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,481
Hi. Duane Bailey. Hi.
Nailed it.

27
00:01:03,815 --> 00:01:05,692
"Actor-writer-director
who packs a punch."

28
00:01:05,817 --> 00:01:08,153
Oh, Sylvester Stallone. I said it first.
Sylvester Stallone.

29
00:01:09,655 --> 00:01:12,282
Oh, my God. This guy
brought his kids, Mitchell.

30
00:01:12,366 --> 00:01:15,244
My God. To this movie? isn't it
supposed to be super violent?

31
00:01:15,327 --> 00:01:17,371
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to overstep,

32
00:01:17,454 --> 00:01:20,165
but I don't know that this movie
is really appropriate for children.

33
00:01:20,249 --> 00:01:23,210
I'm terrified to see it. That's
why we're here during the day.

34
00:01:23,293 --> 00:01:25,504
It's okay. We're good.

35
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,298
Okay. I tried.

36
00:01:28,382 --> 00:01:30,384
Yeah.
All you can do.

37
00:01:31,343 --> 00:01:33,095
You know,
I've read this book,

38
00:01:33,178 --> 00:01:36,306
and I know what's gonna happen,
and it's very disturbing.

39
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,101
I really think you might be inviting
some pretty serious nightmares here.

40
00:01:39,184 --> 00:01:42,062
Hey, buddy,
they're my kids. I got it.

41
00:01:42,187 --> 00:01:45,440
Yeah, but I don't think you do. Cam. Cam.
He says he's got it, all right?

42
00:01:45,524 --> 00:01:48,694
You've said your piece.
Just watch the movie.

43
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,946
Oh, uh, Gwyneth Paltrow.

44
00:01:51,029 --> 00:01:53,282
I really must insist you
not traumatize your kids...

45
00:01:53,407 --> 00:01:55,367
by exposing them to gratuitous
violence- Cam. Stop it.

46
00:01:55,492 --> 00:01:56,952
And graphic depictions of-
Shh, shh.

47
00:01:57,035 --> 00:01:58,745
Daddy, I'm scared.

48
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:00,789
- Yeah, well, you're gonna be.
- I'm gonna tell you one more time.

49
00:02:00,914 --> 00:02:03,000
No, I'm gonna tell you
one more time. Okay.

50
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,085
It was The Muppet Movie.

51
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:07,421
We were
in the wrong theater.

52
00:02:08,755 --> 00:02:11,800
Enjoy the show. I was always
a fan of the Muppets,

53
00:02:11,883 --> 00:02:13,802
especially the two guys in the
theater who wouldn't shut up.

54
00:02:13,885 --> 00:02:15,053
Just leave!

55
00:02:15,887 --> 00:02:17,764
# Hey, hey #

56
00:02:17,848 --> 00:02:19,850
# Hey, hey #

57
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:21,977
# Hey, hey #

58
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,937
# Hey, hey #

59
00:02:24,021 --> 00:02:25,188
# Hey ##

60
00:02:30,485 --> 00:02:31,903
Hello?  I'm running late.

61
00:02:31,987 --> 00:02:34,448
This knucklehead's kept me
waiting for over an hour.

62
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:37,284
I never had to wait like this
when his dad was running things.

63
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:39,453
Yeah.
And soda was a nickel.

64
00:02:39,536 --> 00:02:41,830
Just tell him
that your family is coming over.

65
00:02:41,913 --> 00:02:44,499
This guy fired his own father.
He's not gonna care about my family.

66
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:47,586
Okay, then just leave.
You don't need his money.

67
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:51,089
Once a week, I have eight family members
coming to my house for free food.

68
00:02:51,173 --> 00:02:53,133
I'm not going anywhere.
Okay.

69
00:02:53,216 --> 00:02:55,052
I see you when I see you.

70
00:02:58,013 --> 00:02:59,723
Are you okay? What is wrong?

71
00:02:59,848 --> 00:03:02,476
I wanna be homeschooled.
Really, Manny?

72
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:04,853
Do you want me
to learn you English?

73
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:06,688
What is going on?

74
00:03:06,772 --> 00:03:09,775
I have a big report due in. The teachers
don't seem to care about the substance.

75
00:03:09,858 --> 00:03:11,777
All they care about is the flash.

76
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,404
Manny, sometimes you can be
a little bit old-fashioned.

77
00:03:14,488 --> 00:03:17,949
Remember the first time you saw the
kids with the backpacks with wheels...

78
00:03:18,033 --> 00:03:20,202
and you thought
they were too flashy?

79
00:03:20,285 --> 00:03:22,496
You're going to school,
not boarding a flight to Denver.

80
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:26,375
It's getting absurd. Reuben freestyle-rapped
his report on Irish immigrants.

81
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:30,212
That doesn't even make sense.
Maybe you do a Riverdance. Maybe.

82
00:03:30,337 --> 00:03:32,756
What is your report on?
The mafia.

83
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:36,051
Perfect.
We do a papier-méché tommy gun.

84
00:03:36,134 --> 00:03:37,886
No, we shouldn't have
to jazz it up.

85
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:41,390
Then we go upstairs and we get your old
rocking horse and we chop the head off.

86
00:03:41,473 --> 00:03:44,476
No, that's a terrible idea.
I love Brownie.

87
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:47,771
Do you want to send
a message or not?

88
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:50,357
Jay never wants me
to help him with his business.

89
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,610
And now suddenly, Manny doesn't
want to listen to me either.

90
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:55,404
It's very frustrating.

91
00:03:55,487 --> 00:03:57,489
I have all the answers.

92
00:03:57,614 --> 00:03:59,783
Hey, here he is!

93
00:03:59,908 --> 00:04:02,160
Hey, bring it in, Jay.
How you doing, Joshie?

94
00:04:02,244 --> 00:04:04,413
It's Josh now. Have a seat.

95
00:04:04,496 --> 00:04:06,706
Ah. All right.

96
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,793
So, I flipped through your
proposal, and here's the thing.

97
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:12,754
We're about to build our largest
luxury condo complex yet,

98
00:04:12,838 --> 00:04:14,714
and I have
an important question for you.

99
00:04:14,798 --> 00:04:16,883
What is it
you wanna build?

100
00:04:18,844 --> 00:04:20,095
Closets.

101
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:22,889
See, I was kinda hoping
you'd say dreams.

102
00:04:23,014 --> 00:04:25,475
Thought that was implied.

103
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:28,270
Jay, I'm looking for closets
nobody's ever seen before.

104
00:04:28,353 --> 00:04:30,814
You know, a big "wow!"
You know what I'm saying?

105
00:04:30,897 --> 00:04:34,818
You want a nice closet with sharp design,
quality materials and expert craftsmanship.

106
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:38,447
Uh, I mean, I want it
to be like- Barn!

107
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,909
You know, people are gonna walk in there
and go, "Whoa! What do I hang first?"

108
00:04:42,993 --> 00:04:45,495
I wanted to hang myself.

109
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:47,706
Let's talk more specific.

110
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:49,708
What exactly do you like,
and what don't you like?

111
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,293
All right, fair enough.

112
00:04:51,376 --> 00:04:54,796
Uh, I don't like this.
This makes me sad.

113
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,091
I do like
getting my mind blown.

114
00:04:58,175 --> 00:05:00,010
I love your enthusiasm.

115
00:05:00,093 --> 00:05:04,139
Uh, before I go off in the wrong
direction, how about an example?

116
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:07,142
All right, check this out. So three
weeks ago, I'm down in South Beach.

117
00:05:07,225 --> 00:05:09,269
I walk into this thumpin' club.

118
00:05:09,352 --> 00:05:13,690
Bartender says, "What do you
wanna drink?" I say, "Wow me."

119
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:18,111
He mixes this thing together. I take
one sip, and I'm like, "Hello, nurse!"

120
00:05:18,195 --> 00:05:20,947
And she's like, "You've
been unconscious for two days."

121
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:22,949
That's what I want in a closet.

122
00:05:24,576 --> 00:05:27,078
I don't think
I need to hear any more.

123
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:33,001
What you doing there,
homework?

124
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:35,670
- What do you want?
- I need to borrow some money.

125
00:05:35,754 --> 00:05:37,255
It's really important.

126
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:38,632
How much?

127
00:05:38,715 --> 00:05:40,300
$900.

128
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:42,177
What?
Come on.

129
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,430
If you were in trouble,
I would do anything for you.

130
00:05:45,514 --> 00:05:48,183
We're not just sisters.

131
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:50,393
We're best friends.

132
00:05:51,811 --> 00:05:55,315
Look, I would if I could,
but I don't have any money.

133
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:57,025
And since we're talking,

134
00:05:57,108 --> 00:05:59,444
I- I've never told anyone
this before, and it-

135
00:06:00,904 --> 00:06:04,157
Wipe that smug smile
off his stupid face.

136
00:06:04,241 --> 00:06:05,700
His face is stupid.

137
00:06:05,784 --> 00:06:09,246
Oh, I can't believe ridiculous
people like him end up in office.

138
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:11,289
Well, why don't you run?

139
00:06:11,373 --> 00:06:13,375
You're smart.
You care about the community.

140
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:16,294
And you're easy on the eyes
when you put a little effort into it.

141
00:06:16,378 --> 00:06:17,921
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

142
00:06:18,004 --> 00:06:20,549
Maybe change out of the sweaty gym
clothes every once in a while-

143
00:06:20,632 --> 00:06:24,261
But you were talking about
running for office. Go on.

144
00:06:24,344 --> 00:06:26,388
I'd be lying if I said
I'd never thought about it.

145
00:06:26,471 --> 00:06:28,473
I know it's a ridiculous
little local thing,

146
00:06:28,557 --> 00:06:31,059
but it might be fun to
get out there and contribute.

147
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:32,769
Plus I think I'd be good at it.

148
00:06:32,894 --> 00:06:34,396
You'd be great.
Mmm.

149
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,732
How would this work? Who would be
here for the kids after school?

150
00:06:37,816 --> 00:06:40,026
Who would take them
to practice and recitals...

151
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,487
and keep them from
burning the house down?

152
00:06:42,571 --> 00:06:45,031
It must be so hard
being a single mom.

153
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:47,492
Oh-
Claire, I will.

154
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,162
If you wanna fly, I'm not gonna
hold your feet to the ground.

155
00:06:51,288 --> 00:06:54,374
Hmm. I wanna be the one to
push you off the cliff.

156
00:06:55,292 --> 00:06:58,003
I think I'm gonna do it.
Great.

157
00:06:58,128 --> 00:06:59,546
Go fly.
Phil!

158
00:06:59,671 --> 00:07:01,131
No.
Phil!

159
00:07:02,424 --> 00:07:04,676
I'll admit it.
I'm turned on by powerful women.

160
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:08,763
Michelle Obama, Oprah, Condoleezza
Rice, Serena Williams-

161
00:07:08,847 --> 00:07:10,390
Wait a minute.

162
00:07:14,394 --> 00:07:16,521
Do you want a fry?
No, I can't eat.

163
00:07:16,605 --> 00:07:18,356
We should've stayed
to see the Muppets.

164
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,442
I can't even look at ketchup
without seeing blood.

165
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:22,819
Oh, runaway curly fry.
You know, these are good luck.

166
00:07:25,697 --> 00:07:26,865
Oh!

167
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,908
Oh, my God. What was that?
We just got rear-ended.

168
00:07:28,992 --> 00:07:31,119
Well, pull off to the side street.
Pull off to the side street.

169
00:07:31,244 --> 00:07:34,039
Oh! Are you okay? Oh, I think I cut
the roof of my mouth on the straw.

170
00:07:34,164 --> 00:07:36,082
Oh, my God. Mmm!
So yes.

171
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:40,503
Oh, boy.
I'm so sorry.

172
00:07:40,587 --> 00:07:42,672
This is all my fault.
You guys okay?

173
00:07:42,756 --> 00:07:45,550
Well- Well, I-l sustained
a minor mouth injury.

174
00:07:45,675 --> 00:07:48,470
We're fine, thank you. Look, I feel terrible.

175
00:07:48,553 --> 00:07:50,055
Don't worry. I'm gonna
take care of everything.

176
00:07:50,138 --> 00:07:51,514
Let me just get
my insurance info.

177
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,099
Thank you.

178
00:07:53,224 --> 00:07:54,684
Well, he seems nice.
Yeah.

179
00:07:54,768 --> 00:07:57,520
If this were a romantic comedy,
this would be our meet-cute.

180
00:07:57,604 --> 00:08:01,358
We'd spend the rest of the afternoon
drinking wine, eating food, flying a kite,

181
00:08:01,441 --> 00:08:02,942
you know,
doing montage-y stuff.

182
00:08:03,068 --> 00:08:05,904
Am I in this movie of yours? Yeah,
you're the gay best friend.

183
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:07,614
Oh, my God!

184
00:08:07,739 --> 00:08:10,450
Oh, my God! We got a runner!
Um, it's D-1- I can't read it.

185
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:12,327
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Go where?

186
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,245
- We have to chase him down!
- You're not supposed to.

187
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:16,331
Help! Stop that car!

188
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:18,416
He's getting away! Help!

189
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,336
You almost got him, Cam.
You almost got him.

190
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,254
He's getting away!

191
00:08:25,382 --> 00:08:28,093
Hey. What you doing, playing?

192
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,220
Yeah.

193
00:08:30,303 --> 00:08:32,722
Do you have any money saved up?

194
00:08:33,765 --> 00:08:35,767
I'm comfortable.

195
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:40,105
I've saved $1,217.
It wasn't even that hard.

196
00:08:40,188 --> 00:08:42,357
Don't forget your lunch.

197
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,734
Thanks, Mom.

198
00:08:44,818 --> 00:08:46,778
Don't forget
your lunch money, buddy.

199
00:08:46,903 --> 00:08:48,905
Thanks, Dad.
You bet.

200
00:08:53,368 --> 00:08:55,537
Please.
it's really important.

201
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,791
Look, I'd love to help you out,
but I'm not very liquid right now.

202
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:01,626
It's in a block of ice.

203
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:06,423
I got the idea when I heard about
rich guyswith frozen assets.

204
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,634
"Ass-ets."

205
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:14,556
I am running
for town council,

206
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:17,308
and I understand
that I can pick up a form here.

207
00:09:17,392 --> 00:09:20,311
Fourth floor.
Elevator down the hall.

208
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:22,981
Beyoncé, when'd you start working here?

209
00:09:23,064 --> 00:09:26,609
Oh, Duane. He's always
saying stuff like that.

210
00:09:26,693 --> 00:09:28,445
Duane Bailey.
Running for reelection.

211
00:09:28,528 --> 00:09:29,821
You're joking.

212
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:31,823
I just saw you in the
parking lot two hours ago.

213
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:33,241
Oh!

214
00:09:33,324 --> 00:09:37,120
Hey, it's you. Oh, it's you.
What are you doing here?

215
00:09:37,203 --> 00:09:41,416
I am entering the race for town
council, and I am running against you.

216
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:43,585
Oh. Well,
don't you have pluck.

217
00:09:43,668 --> 00:09:46,129
No, I plan on winning, so-
Yeah, I bet you do.

218
00:09:46,212 --> 00:09:48,715
Marsha! Rockin' the bangs.
Love it

219
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:51,342
Do you know why, of all the dogs
in the world, I breed puggles?

220
00:09:51,426 --> 00:09:53,928
Why do I feel like this is a rhetorical
question, and you're about to lau-

221
00:09:54,012 --> 00:09:55,638
it's because
they're lovable, yes,

222
00:09:55,722 --> 00:10:00,185
but they're also tenacious hunters who
won't quit until the kill is complete.

223
00:10:00,268 --> 00:10:02,312
Really? 'Cause I feel
like they just yip a lot.

224
00:10:02,395 --> 00:10:04,314
Look, lady,
you're going down.

225
00:10:04,397 --> 00:10:07,692
I've won six straight elections. I don't
plan on losing to some bored housewife.

226
00:10:07,776 --> 00:10:11,571
So don't quit
your lack of a day job.

227
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:13,323
Excuse me!

228
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:16,117
Excuse me! I-

229
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:17,577
Excuse me.

230
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,954
Hello?

231
00:10:20,038 --> 00:10:21,080
Anne?

232
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,417
Haley did that?

233
00:10:24,501 --> 00:10:26,836
Oh, God. Okay, um-

234
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,339
I'll call you right back.

235
00:10:29,422 --> 00:10:33,802
For your information, sir,
I am no bored housewife.

236
00:10:33,885 --> 00:10:37,347
L-I would kill for bored.
Why isn't this lighting up?

237
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:41,142
Oh, it's because
it's staff only. The, uh-

238
00:10:41,226 --> 00:10:45,355
Here. Allow me to...
not get that for you.

239
00:10:45,438 --> 00:10:47,357
Good luck!

240
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,737
Dad, I cut my arm.

241
00:10:52,821 --> 00:10:54,823
Oh, wow.
You sure did, buddy.

242
00:10:54,948 --> 00:10:57,200
Ow.
I'll get you fixed up.

243
00:10:57,283 --> 00:10:58,368
Where's Mom?

244
00:10:58,451 --> 00:11:00,411
She belongs
to the people now.

245
00:11:00,495 --> 00:11:03,039
My allergies
are acting up again.

246
00:11:03,122 --> 00:11:05,708
Well, it is your lucky day,

247
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:10,839
because, missy, Dr. Dad
has everything you need.

248
00:11:10,922 --> 00:11:14,926
Behold the healing powers
of grape flavoring.

249
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:17,136
- Where's Mom?
- Some people took her.

250
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,930
Drink this.
Listen, guys.

251
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:23,476
Your mom is taking on more
responsibilities outside of the house.

252
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,646
But don't you worry.
Good old-

253
00:11:26,771 --> 00:11:28,857
Oh, my goodness!
Ow!

254
00:11:28,982 --> 00:11:31,734
I'm so sorry.
You punched me.

255
00:11:31,818 --> 00:11:33,945
Dad, you gave me
the drowsy kind.

256
00:11:34,028 --> 00:11:35,572
There's a drowsy kind?

257
00:11:35,655 --> 00:11:38,616
- I have to study for a test!
- Oh, it really hurts!

258
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:40,743
Well, I'll get you some ice.
No, no, no, no!

259
00:11:40,827 --> 00:11:42,328
I'll get it.

260
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:49,711
Oh, you made it.
How was it?

261
00:11:49,836 --> 00:11:51,671
Eh.
Why? What's wrong, babe?

262
00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:54,757
I don't wanna talk about it.
Do it anyways.

263
00:11:54,841 --> 00:11:56,926
This stupid kid's been in the
business about 10 minutes.

264
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:00,889
He barely looks at my proposal,
and he says he wants more "wow."

265
00:12:00,972 --> 00:12:02,682
What does he mean
by more "wow"?

266
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:04,434
It's the Bieberization
of America.

267
00:12:04,517 --> 00:12:06,227
What do beavers have
to do with anything?

268
00:12:06,311 --> 00:12:09,814
The beavers, they build the dams all
over the country so there's no floods.

269
00:12:09,898 --> 00:12:12,859
It's the beaverization
of the Americas.

270
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:16,321
I'm finding there's less and
less we can talk about.

271
00:12:16,404 --> 00:12:20,158
So why didn't you tell him that you've
been in the business for such a long time-

272
00:12:20,241 --> 00:12:22,660
Gloria, it's not gonna make any difference.
He wants to make a change.

273
00:12:22,744 --> 00:12:24,704
And I got a factory full of
people depending on this.

274
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:26,456
Yeah, but
maybe if you tell him that-

275
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:30,168
Gloria, please. I've had a tough day.
Can we please not talk about it?

276
00:12:30,293 --> 00:12:33,296
But I want to help. Trust me.
I wish you had the answers.

277
00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:35,214
I do!

278
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,883
Hey, guys.
Hey, Grandpa.

279
00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:39,302
Hey, Grandpa. Hey, Jay.

280
00:12:39,427 --> 00:12:41,471
What's with her? Just tired.
Growth spurt.

281
00:12:41,596 --> 00:12:43,640
Hey, hey.
Hi, guys.

282
00:12:43,723 --> 00:12:46,559
- Hi, baby girl.
- Hola, Lily.

283
00:12:46,643 --> 00:12:48,102
How are you?

284
00:12:48,186 --> 00:12:50,605
Dads are fighting.
No. Uh, we're not fighting.

285
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:53,858
No, not at all, honey. No. Uh,
go play, sweetheart. Okay?

286
00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:56,736
Let's go play with some blocks. Let's
go stack some blocks. All right.

287
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:59,739
Okay. The reason we're fighting is
'cause this one thinks he's Dirty Harry.

288
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:01,991
Having a tough time picturing
Clint Eastwood in that shirt.

289
00:13:02,075 --> 00:13:04,827
Okay, let me ask you something.
Today, at a stoplight,

290
00:13:04,911 --> 00:13:07,497
a guy ran into our car
and then just took off.

291
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,582
I wanted to chase after him.
Mitchell-

292
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,960
Kept a level head
and called the police.

293
00:13:12,043 --> 00:13:15,588
Police. Aren't they too busy
winning the war on drugs?

294
00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:18,424
Okay, so which one of us
did the right thing?

295
00:13:18,508 --> 00:13:20,426
Hit-and-run. Gotta chase 'em down.

296
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,011
I chase the people
all the time.

297
00:13:22,095 --> 00:13:24,722
No, no. That-That's
irresponsible and dangerous.

298
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:27,767
What if he had been armed? He wasn't armed.
He had a Hillary bumper sticker.

299
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,602
This isn't
an isolated incident.

300
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,480
This morning, he flipped out at somebody
at The Muppet' Movie.

301
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:35,316
You saw The Muppet' Movie
without me?

302
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,069
- Oh, no.
- No, honey, just the first two numbers.

303
00:13:38,194 --> 00:13:39,904
No. Lily-  Hi, hi, hi.

304
00:13:39,988 --> 00:13:41,948
Phil, where are you, honey?
I need to talk to you.

305
00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:43,491
Do you know
what our daughter did?

306
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:45,159
Nothing. She's fine.
She's reading.

307
00:13:45,243 --> 00:13:47,328
No, not her. Haley. Haley!

308
00:13:47,453 --> 00:13:49,372
Come over here. I wanna talk to you.
There she is.

309
00:13:49,455 --> 00:13:50,999
Not a scratch on her.

310
00:13:51,082 --> 00:13:53,668
You have something you
wanna say to us? Uh-

311
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:55,878
Mmm, let me
help you out here.

312
00:13:55,962 --> 00:13:57,880
Fake I.D.'s?
What?

313
00:13:57,964 --> 00:14:02,343
Mm-hmm. Haley tried to get her and
her friends some fake I.D.'s.

314
00:14:02,427 --> 00:14:04,512
I wasn't going to use them
for drinking.

315
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:07,056
We just wanted to get
into this club to see a band.

316
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,184
She took a bunch of money from
them, and then she lost it.

317
00:14:10,268 --> 00:14:12,020
How much?
$900.

318
00:14:12,145 --> 00:14:14,397
Oh, my God! Oh!
You're kidding me!

319
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,693
It's not my fault! I gave money to this guy.
He's the one who ripped us off.

320
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:20,737
What happened
to your face?

321
00:14:20,862 --> 00:14:23,781
Oh. I ran into a door.
Yeah.

322
00:14:23,865 --> 00:14:25,491
- What happened to your face?
- Dad hit me.

323
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:27,118
It was an accident.
Phil!

324
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:29,412
I was trying to open up a Band-Aid.

325
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:31,831
- What's wrong with her?
- Growth spurt.

326
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:33,708
- What's wrong with her?
- I drugged her.

327
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,836
Phil- I accidentally gave her
the nighttime allergy medicine.

328
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,380
Mmm. All right,
one thing at a time.

329
00:14:39,464 --> 00:14:42,341
Haley, how are you going
to repay your friends?

330
00:14:42,467 --> 00:14:44,177
I don't know.  I know.

331
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,845
You go there
with a couple of guys-

332
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:47,930
She's gotta get the money back.
Who is this kid?

333
00:14:48,014 --> 00:14:50,892
A guy at school's cousin's friend.
He lives in Gardena.

334
00:14:50,975 --> 00:14:52,935
Well, if you know where he
lives, just call the police.

335
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:55,605
No cops. We can't afford
a scandal right now.

336
00:14:55,688 --> 00:14:57,732
Claire's running
for town council.

337
00:14:57,815 --> 00:15:00,735
That was before, when I thought you
could take care of the children.

338
00:15:00,818 --> 00:15:03,029
I take my eye off
the ball for one minute,

339
00:15:03,112 --> 00:15:06,365
and I've got one in a coma, one with a
black eye and one running a crime ring.

340
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:09,077
Well, to be fair,
Haley started her crime ring...

341
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,162
when your eye
was still on the ball.

342
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:12,914
It's not a crime ring.

343
00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:15,416
I just gotta get
my hands on that $900.

344
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,668
I know how the mafia
would handle this.

345
00:15:17,794 --> 00:15:20,296
The kid is right.

346
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:23,007
I'm sick of these smart-ass punks
who keep changing the rules...

347
00:15:23,091 --> 00:15:25,093
and think they can get away
with anything they want.

348
00:15:25,176 --> 00:15:27,512
I'm gonna pay this guy a visit.
Haley, text me his address.

349
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:29,097
I'm going with you.
Me too.

350
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,183
Oh, no. No. Nobody's going anywhere, okay?
We're not vigilantes.

351
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:35,186
Shotgun!
No! No weapons!

352
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,318
In my country,
it is tradition.

353
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:44,362
When the men are out
seeking vengeance,

354
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:46,364
the women stay home
and they drink.

355
00:15:46,447 --> 00:15:48,950
Sometimes I think
you just make this stuff up.

356
00:15:49,075 --> 00:15:51,786
Do you want a drink or not?
Oh, yeah.

357
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:54,163
So, what happened?

358
00:15:54,247 --> 00:15:56,332
You were running for office,
and now you're not?

359
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,292
Mmm. I don't really
wanna talk about that.

360
00:15:58,376 --> 00:16:01,504
Ay, no. I am sick and tired
of no one needing my help.

361
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:03,631
You are going to tell me
what is wrong,

362
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:07,009
and I'm gonna give you the right
answer, because I have all of them.

363
00:16:07,093 --> 00:16:10,012
So, why are you not
running for office?

364
00:16:10,096 --> 00:16:13,599
Because my family needs me too much.
You saw what just happened.

365
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:17,019
Why are you not running for office?
Uh, that doesn't work with me.

366
00:16:17,103 --> 00:16:18,938
Why are you
not running for office?

367
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:21,315
Because I don't want to lose!

368
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:26,445
I- I haven't done anything
outside of my house in 18 years.

369
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:29,407
I don't want the first thing I
do to be a complete failure.

370
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:32,034
Okay.

371
00:16:32,118 --> 00:16:36,914
I'm gonna tell you a story about a little
girl who entered a beauty pageant-

372
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,791
even though ...

373
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,627
She was very, very scared
that she was going to lose.

374
00:16:41,711 --> 00:16:43,588
Let me guess.
You won.

375
00:16:43,713 --> 00:16:46,549
Of course I won. But I was talking
about my cousin Maria Conchita.

376
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:49,969
She had a nose like a toucan. She
stuff her body in this bikini.

377
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:53,014
And at the end,
she finish dead last.

378
00:16:53,097 --> 00:16:55,808
How is that a good story?

379
00:16:55,892 --> 00:16:59,896
She faced her fears,
and it didn't kill her.

380
00:17:01,606 --> 00:17:03,733
What killed her
two weeks later was a bus.

381
00:17:03,816 --> 00:17:05,318
Are you serious?

382
00:17:05,401 --> 00:17:08,779
Because she couldn't see anything
coming with that big nose.

383
00:17:09,614 --> 00:17:12,116
This guy has won
six elections.

384
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,118
I am way out of my league.

385
00:17:14,202 --> 00:17:15,870
Look, I don't know
anything about this guy.

386
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:18,122
But I know
that you're a tough lady,

387
00:17:18,206 --> 00:17:20,374
and I come from a family
of tough ladies.

388
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:23,461
And I have to say, sometimes
you scare me a little bit.

389
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:26,255
And I know that you're
strong enough to win...

390
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:29,425
and definitely strong enough
to be okay if you lose.

391
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:32,511
I scare you?
Are you kidding me?

392
00:17:32,595 --> 00:17:35,681
"I want
Thanksgiving at my house!"

393
00:17:35,765 --> 00:17:38,476
Why does everybody
think I talk like that?

394
00:17:41,646 --> 00:17:43,356
This is it.

395
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:47,026
Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no, come on.
Do we have a plan?

396
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:49,320
It doesn't seem like we have a plan.
Yeah, I got a plan.

397
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,697
Either he gives us the money, or
he gets a private performance...

398
00:17:51,781 --> 00:17:53,866
from England Dan
and John Ford Coley.

399
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,910
That's not a good plan.
That's not even a good band.

400
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:58,746
If all you're gonna do is
criticize, just wait by the car.

401
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:00,248
Okay, fine.

402
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:02,250
I'll see you in jail.

403
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,377
It's gonna be a big
adjustment for two of you.

404
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:15,429
Yeah?
You Peter?

405
00:18:15,513 --> 00:18:17,431
What do you want?
You know Haley Dunphy?

406
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:20,518
You owe her $900. We're
here to collect. You dig?

407
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:24,855
I tried to call that girl 10 times,
but her voice mail was always full.

408
00:18:24,939 --> 00:18:26,440
That does sound
like Haley.

409
00:18:26,524 --> 00:18:28,567
So how are you
gonna make this right?

410
00:18:28,651 --> 00:18:30,611
You guys want the money, right?
That's fine.

411
00:18:30,695 --> 00:18:32,697
I don't need any hassle.
Hold on.

412
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,782
I'll just-
I'll grab it.

413
00:18:38,286 --> 00:18:40,454
That was easy.

414
00:18:40,538 --> 00:18:42,331
He's lucky
he didn't put up a fight.

415
00:18:42,415 --> 00:18:46,669
I would've treated him to a reunion
of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young.

416
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:50,339
- Oh, my God! We got a runner!
- Stop!

417
00:18:50,423 --> 00:18:51,924
- Get him! Get him!
- Stop!

418
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:54,552
Stop!

419
00:18:56,012 --> 00:18:58,180
No!No!No!

420
00:18:58,306 --> 00:19:00,057
No!

421
00:19:00,141 --> 00:19:01,851
Got him!

422
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:04,687
- Oh, my God! You did!
- Don't be so surprised!

423
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,272
Help! He's slipping out
of his skinny jeans!

424
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:07,315
Okay!

425
00:19:09,442 --> 00:19:11,444
These are cute.
I totally have these.

426
00:19:13,738 --> 00:19:15,281
Hmm?
Ah-ha-ha.

427
00:19:15,406 --> 00:19:17,700
Oh! There you go.

428
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:19,285
Oh, you got it back!
Thank you!

429
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:21,412
Hey, don't thank me.
Thank your Uncle Mitchell.

430
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:24,123
He's the one who tackled the guy.
I got grass stains.

431
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:26,834
Well, I will
tell you one thing.

432
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:28,878
I have learned my lesson.

433
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:32,465
Disappointing my family and
friends is punishment enough.

434
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:35,509
Nice try. You're
grounded for two weeks.

435
00:19:35,593 --> 00:19:38,387
Okay, we have big news.

436
00:19:38,471 --> 00:19:43,059
Claire has decided
to run for mayor after all.

437
00:19:43,142 --> 00:19:45,102
Thank you.
it's town council.

438
00:19:45,186 --> 00:19:47,146
It doesn't matter.
You're not going to win anyways.

439
00:19:48,147 --> 00:19:50,149
But she's going to be okay.
You see?

440
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:53,903
I help the people. Why don't
you two let me help you?

441
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:55,988
Well, I can't
speak for Jay,

442
00:19:56,072 --> 00:19:59,533
but I guess I'm just too
proud to ask for help.

443
00:19:59,617 --> 00:20:01,660
Are you serious?
She cuts your steak.

444
00:20:01,744 --> 00:20:04,997
- What about you?
- I don't wanna bother you with my business.

445
00:20:05,081 --> 00:20:06,916
- What else do I do every day?
- I don't know.

446
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:10,002
I'm guessing the gym
and... one other thing.

447
00:20:10,086 --> 00:20:13,089
Dad, you should listen to her.
She might really help you.

448
00:20:13,214 --> 00:20:15,424
Huh.
She could be an asset.

449
00:20:17,468 --> 00:20:19,762
"Ass-et."
Heard it.

450
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:21,055
Hmm.

451
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:23,391
And look at the shelves
over here.

452
00:20:23,474 --> 00:20:26,018
They're for the shoes.
Those are my favorite ones.

453
00:20:26,102 --> 00:20:27,603
So what did you think?

454
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:31,482
Wow.

455
00:20:33,401 --> 00:20:36,737
Same exact closet.

456
00:20:40,825 --> 00:20:42,576
We never needed fake I.D.'s
on a farm.

457
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,247
We figured if a 16-year-old could drive
a tractor, he could drink a beer.

458
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,916
Not at the same time, of course.
it's Missouri, not Texas.

459
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:52,586
I used a fake I.D.
to get into an R-rated movie.

460
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,588
The Fabulous Baker Boys.

461
00:20:54,672 --> 00:20:56,632
I found the title
to be misleading.

462
00:20:56,715 --> 00:20:58,717
Lot of Michelle Pfeiffer.
That's all I'm saying.

463
00:20:58,801 --> 00:21:00,845
I remember
when I got my fake I.D.

464
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:03,264
- Me too. Crazy times.
- Hell, yeah.

465
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:05,599
I tried to enlist in the army,
but they saw right through me.

466
00:21:05,683 --> 00:21:07,643
So me and a bunch of guys
drove across state lines.

467
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:10,229
We got a bunch of booze.
We loaded up on fireworks.

468
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:14,608
And I woke up in the morning,
I kid you not, in a Mexican strip joint.

469
00:21:14,692 --> 00:21:17,611
I .

470
00:21:17,695 --> 00:21:21,115
Oh, I used mine to rent
some bowling shoes and kept 'em.

471
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:25,035
Suckers probably spent months
trying to track down Dr. Richard Hertz.

472
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,122
Think about it.

473
00:21:35,254 --> 00:21:36,255
English - US - PSDH
