1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,925
Okay, let's see.

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,881
Could you grab me
an extra-virgin-

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,929
I think one's enough for the sacrifice.
Olive oil, Phil.

4
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,681
Come on. That's funny.

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,513
Oh, it's funnier than your
freestyle sandwich rap.

6
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:14,849
Girl, you crazy.

7
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:17,105
I'm mad fun to shop with.

8
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,733
# Trapped in between
two whole wheat slices #

9
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:22,690
# Pastrami and Swiss
are my only vices #

10
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:25,697
Sweetie, my shoe.
Come on. Geez. God.

11
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:26,868
Hello.

12
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,612
Hi. Oh, roadblock. Sorry.

13
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,242
Beep, beep. Hah, hah. Pardon me.

14
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,288
Are you okay? Oh!

15
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:37,963
Actually, not okay.
Not okay.

16
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,133
Honey. Did you pull
from the bottom again?

17
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:47,097
So after hors d'oeuvres, we'll bring
everyone in here to share the news.

18
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:49,891
We're having the family over
tomorrow night ...

19
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:52,686
to tell them we're planning
on adopting a new baby.

20
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:56,766
Yes, and we both agreed to go a little more
low-key with the announcement this time.

21
00:00:56,848 --> 00:01:00,523
# Let's hear it for the boy
Ah, let's give- #

22
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:04,072
Okay, just to be clear- This is low-key?

23
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,866
It's a banner and just some light
musical accompaniment, Mitchell.

24
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:08,410
I don't have a lower key.

25
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,237
Besides,
this is a happy occasion.

26
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,618
Am I right, Lily? Aren't you
excited to get a new baby brother?

27
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:15,076
No. I hate the baby.

28
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,754
We are having a slight issue ...

29
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:21,298
getting Lily on board
with the adoption.

30
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,088
"L hate the baby."
"No new baby."

31
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,668
"I want to make the baby dead."

32
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,345
I thought we weren't
gonna share that one.

33
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:31,676
L-I just hope that the problem is she
hasn't spent much time with any babies.

34
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,760
So we thought it would be
a great idea ...

35
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:36,063
to show her how much fun
it'll be to have one around.

36
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:39,608
Oh, he is so cute. Yeah,
and he never cries.

37
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:42,899
Literally never.
it's actually a little weird.

38
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:46,198
Oh, no, that's not weird. My sister was
born with a full set of teeth. Yeah.

39
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,071
That never happened.
No? Really?

40
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,403
You should've seen her crib. It
looked like beavers lived there.

41
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,953
Oh, is this Lily?

42
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:54,782
Oh, yes, it is. Hey, honey.
Say hi to the baby.

43
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,993
- My daddy!
- Oh!

44
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,166
Okay. Well,
that's one problem solved.

45
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:09,840
# Hey, hey #

46
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,093
# Hey ##

47
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,892
Bye! See you soon.

48
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,604
Or never.

49
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,647
Cam, I'm a little freaked out
about what Lily did.

50
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,270
Oh, please.
She barely touched him ...

51
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,068
and he went from zero
to big crybaby.

52
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,646
We're talking about bringing
another child into this house.

53
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,949
How's that gonna work with Lily
being so possessive of you?

54
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:31,402
Why am I hearing
an accusatory tone?

55
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,829
Oh, come on. You have to admit
that you do coddle her.

56
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,202
I will not apologize
for loving our daughter.

57
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,578
I'm not criticizing.

58
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,411
I'm not only criticizing,

59
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,838
but we did talk about giving
Lily a little more independence.

60
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,506
Yeah, which is why
we put her in preschool.

61
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,084
Yes, but you can't bear to leave her there.
You always pick her up early.

62
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,632
That is ridiculous.
Okay, okay.

63
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,009
Lily, honey.

64
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:53,841
Did Daddy pick you up
early from preschool today?

65
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:56,598
- No.
- Case closed.

66
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,054
We didn't go.

67
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,389
- Case opened.
- We went shopping.

68
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:02,395
That's enough.

69
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,192
We bought matchy hats.

70
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,769
You are going
to your room.

71
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,693
You're both going to her room.

72
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:10,524
Do we spend
a lot of time together? Yes.

73
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,325
Do we have a special bond?
Absolutely.

74
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:16,577
But do I coddle her more
than any other loving parent?

75
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,749
Mm-hmm.

76
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,554
It's possible.

77
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,473
And for Lily's sake,
I should probably work on that.

78
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,971
No, you calm down!

79
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,350
This is how I talk when somebody
accuses my Manny of stealing!

80
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,722
Who is that?
it's the principal.

81
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,024
He's saying that Manny stole
some girl's locket.

82
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,103
What? You think that all
Colombians are criminals ...

83
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:51,816
because the Colombian necktie is a
symbol of violence all over the world?

84
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,992
Oh, no,
I'm not threatening you.

85
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,911
Okay, apology accepted.

86
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,580
No, I didn't mean anything
about the necktie.

87
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,453
I just- I was trying
to make a point.

88
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,752
Could you "L"
a little less "O-L"?

89
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,553
Don't you see what
I'm trying to do here?

90
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,389
Die alone? Girls, dinner!

91
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:20,181
Why does Luke get his own room and I still have
to share with you? I can't take it anymore.

92
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,811
Me either. Even if it is just for one
more year, when I leave for college.

93
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,858
Is it one more year, or when
you'll leave for college?

94
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,856
Because those happen to be
two different things.

95
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,478
Uh-

96
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,781
So I hear this little voice
coming from the cans,

97
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:36,076
and it's like, "Help!
I fell in the peaches!"

98
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,404
It's Mom.

99
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,622
Hilarious. So hilarious.
I'm, like, "Claire?"

100
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:44,247
You might want to tell them that it was you who
pushed me into the peaches in the first place.

101
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:45,953
This again.
I wasn't even near you.

102
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,959
Yes, you were. You knocked
me with the cart.

103
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,416
It was completely
your fault.

104
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,092
Well, let's just
agree to disagree.

105
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:55,546
No, I-l disagree
to disagree.

106
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,506
Then you agree.

107
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,933
No. No, I don't,
because I'm right.

108
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,971
Okay, Claire.
You're right.

109
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,227
- As usual.
- No, I am right.

110
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,774
Like always.
Stop it.

111
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,351
When I am wrong, I admit it.

112
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,777
Which is never.

113
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,071
Fine. Fine.

114
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:20,404
You're a little jumpy tonight, Manny.
Anything wrong? No.

115
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,999
Well, I'm just gonna-
Have a seat, kid.

116
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:27,749
You know, maybe it's me, but I thought
you were kind of squirrelly tonight-

117
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,668
you know, before, when your mom was
on the phone with the principal.

118
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,669
Almost like you wanted to say
something, but you just couldn't.

119
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,422
Anything you want to say now,
Manny?

120
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,017
No.
I got nothing to say.

121
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,094
You sure about that?

122
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,809
Think real hard.

123
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,232
Could I get
a glass of water?

124
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,153
That girl's locket.
You took it, didn't you?

125
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:56,573
Um-
Didn't you?

126
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,492
Yes. Yes, I took it.
I didn't mean to.

127
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,696
I don't want to hear
any excuses.

128
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,827
You're gonna tell your mom, and you're
gonna set this right, you understand?

129
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:07,910
All right, get outta here.

130
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,996
Just one more thing.

131
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,581
You're not, uh-

132
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,126
You're not wearing
that locket, are you?

133
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,837
No, of course not. it's a girl's.
Why would I want to wear it?

134
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,840
No reason.

135
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:31,059
Mom, hurry up. I
don't want to be late for school.

136
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,684
You didn't
tell her, did you?

137
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:36,647
Ay. What's the hurry
this morning?

138
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:42,737
Okay, what's with the looks?
it's like a silent movie in here.

139
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:46,414
Okay. I was walking behind this
girl, Alisha, who was moving away,

140
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:49,868
and I was working up the courage to get
her new address so I can write her.

141
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:53,122
I express myself a lot better
on paper than- Ticktock, kid.

142
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:58,051
Well, she dropped her locket, and I picked
it up, but she kept walking, and I-

143
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:01,721
You stole the locket.

144
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:05,096
After I told the principal that you could
have never done something like that,

145
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,394
and I threaten him
with the Colombian necktie!

146
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,062
Manny, why?

147
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,231
Don't worry. It wasn't
'cause he wanted to wear it.

148
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,227
I thought I could keep it
as something to remember her by.

149
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,404
But then you were yelling
at Mr. Vickers, and ...

150
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:18,901
I was just too scared
to tell you.

151
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,399
Go to the car.
I'm really sorry.

152
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:21,483
Go.

153
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,329
Why would he do
something like that?

154
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:29,248
It's bad enough that he's the
boy with the pan ?ute ...

155
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,747
and the puffy shirts
and-and the poems.

156
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,453
Now he's the jewelry thief.

157
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,502
Might be an upgrade.
Ay, Jay, this is not funny.

158
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,299
Those things stick to you.

159
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,128
My cousin Rosa Marina, when she
was]4, she stole something,

160
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:44,761
and after that, everybody thinks of
her as the girl who steals cars.

161
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,430
She stole a car?
Cars.

162
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,558
But after she got that label,
what else could she do?

163
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,982
Listen, you can't control what kids think,
but you can make sure he learns from this.

164
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,479
You take him to
the principal's office.

165
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,777
He owns up to it.
He never does it again.

166
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,321
Okay, okay.

167
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,944
But what was he thinking?

168
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,991
This is not even real gold.

169
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:09,119
No way, Haley! It was my idea!
I'm taking this room!

170
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,120
Over my dead body!

171
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,547
This is going to be my room, and
there's nothing you can do about it!

172
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,958
Seriously?

173
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,214
What are you guys
fighting about?

174
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:25,672
Okay, so we both think that this would
make a totally awesome bedroom.

175
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,759
But only one of us can have it.
Don't you think it should be me?

176
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,765
Oh, so not. It should
be me, right, Luke?

177
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,097
Why do you guys want to
move into the attic?

178
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,181
Oh, you mean the penthouse?

179
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:38,769
With all the privacy of being
on its very own floor?

180
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,940
It is kinda cool.

181
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:47,870
I'm not an idiot.
I knew what they were up to.

182
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,197
But I've been wanting to move
for a while.

183
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,375
There's a line of ants going to a
trick or treat bag in my closet,

184
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,454
and I don't want to still be there
when they get tired of candy.

185
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,790
Good morning, princess.
Good morning, Lily.

186
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:03,468
That's very adorable, Mitchell, but
I'm having kind of a rough morning.

187
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,341
Daddy, up.

188
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,468
I'm sorry, Lily.
Those days are over.

189
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,175
Now, here's your lunch.
Go get your bag.

190
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,306
We will be leaving shortly.

191
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,059
Cam, you don't have to
ice her out completely.

192
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,811
Do you think
I'm enjoying this?

193
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,439
But I need her to detach from me
before the new thing comes,

194
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,190
or who knows
what she'll do to it.

195
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,522
Why are you saying "thing"
instead of "baby"?

196
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,573
Kill new baby.

197
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:26,649
Oh.

198
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,735
Um, look,
I-l know this is hard,

199
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,912
but I really appreciate
what you're doing.

200
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:34,116
And believe me, I take no pleasure
in seeing you suffer like this.

201
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,293
I take a little pleasure.

202
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:39,246
No, but there are very few parenting
issues where I come out on top.

203
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:42,424
You know, I'm distant.
I work too much.

204
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:45,469
My French braiding is "sloppy."

205
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,387
Finally, you know,
something that isn't my fault.

206
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,349
Ready- Okay.

207
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,644
Could you please just go put her in
her car seat while I compose myself?

208
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:58,064
Right. You know what, Cam? Why don't I just
take Lily to preschool on my way to work?

209
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,609
I think that would be best. Let me just
whip up a smoothie for you before you go.

210
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,528
I push the buttons, Daddy.

211
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,024
You certainly do.

212
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,991
What do you think the
principal's going to do to me?

213
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,035
I am a first-time offender.

214
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,242
Oh, great, now I'm tardy.
Strike two.

215
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,247
Manny, think of this
in a positive way.

216
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,712
Like it is your "ha-ha" moment.
What does that mean?

217
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,915
That means that one day
you're gonna laugh about it.

218
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,091
I should have just gave that
stupid necklace back to Alisha ...

219
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,168
when she was standing
right next to her locker.

220
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,300
This is the
worst day of my life.

221
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,802
Till tomorrow,
and every day after that.

222
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:35,977
Come on, Morn.
Let's just get this over with.

223
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,929
Wait.

224
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,773
What? Which one did you say
that it was her locker?

225
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:44,399
- This one?
- Mm-hmm. The one that smells like rose oil.

226
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,654
Mom?

227
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,232
Keep the lookout.

228
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,322
Now promise me that you will never
ever do anything dishonest again.

229
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:58,791
I promise. Okay, because that's
not the way I raised you.

230
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,081
Don't tell Jay anything, okay?
Mm-mmm.

231
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,749
All right, Lily.
Hi, Lily.

232
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,672
Hi.
Have fun, sweetheart.

233
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,375
Bye.
She is so sweet.

234
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,177
Oh, thanks. Well, you
should've seen her yesterday.

235
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,506
Yeah. She pushed
a baby off of Cam's lap.

236
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,382
Huh.
I know, I know.

237
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,967
She is so possessive
of him.

238
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,179
But, Cam's really working on trying
not to coddle her so much, so-

239
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:22,357
Mm-hmm. I'm not really
sure it's about coddling.

240
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,230
Sounds more like
a sharing issue.

241
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,607
You know, we've noticed
Lily has a hard time with that.

242
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,776
Really?
I wouldn't worry.

243
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,358
Kids usually pick that habit up
from other kids.

244
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,115
Except the ones who pick it up
from their parents.

245
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,242
We have a few of those in here.

246
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,039
Of course, I can't share
those names with you.

247
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,458
Until I get a glass of wine in my hand.

248
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,753
Oh. Oh, Miss Elaine.

249
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:47,708
I have been told that I might have
the teensiest issue with sharing.

250
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,215
But is that something
Lily would even pick up on?

251
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,139
My chicken.

252
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,597
My pillow.
Ow.

253
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,596
Daddy's pen.
Crayons.

254
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:07,694
Okay, it's possible, and I suppose for
Lily's sake, I-l should work on that.

255
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,989
Yeah, privately.
Because right now,

256
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:14,318
we really need to get Cam's
coddling problem under control.

257
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,581
What's going on?
Moving into the attic.

258
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,909
Give me a day or two to get
settled, and I'll have you up.

259
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:25,003
When did all this happen?
Depends on who you ask.

260
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,251
My plan's been in motion
for three weeks.

261
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,584
Honey, this is a terrible idea.
You're gonna hate it up there.

262
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,294
Morn, stay out of this.

263
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,971
Yeah, we all have our own rooms now.
Everybody wins.

264
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:37,140
Well, don't get too
comfortable in there, girls.

265
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,968
Luke, it's cold
and it's scary up there.

266
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:41,928
You're gonna be back in your
own room by tomorrow night.

267
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,309
I don't know, Claire.
It's got a lot of potential.

268
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:47,313
This is a lot nicer than the
attic I lived in when we met.

269
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,986
One night, if that.
Trust me on this.

270
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:52,439
Oh, yes, because
you are always right.

271
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,695
Sweetheart,
I would love to be wrong.

272
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,197
I just don't live with the
right people for that.

273
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,780
Let it go, kids.
She's not gonna budge.

274
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:03,124
Kept me up all night with-
Phil, you did push me!

275
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,328
Your word against mine. Guess it's one
of those things we'll just never know.

276
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:07,913
Like what really happened
to the Titanic.

277
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,873
It hit an iceberg.

278
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,295
Maybe.
Mmm, there's no maybe.

279
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,592
Oh, you're right, Claire.

280
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:16,888
- Again.
- Surprise, surprise.

281
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:20,638
Okay, I will see you
over at Uncle Mitchell's.

282
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:24,642
I'm going to skip this meeting
of the "pile on Claire club."

283
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,223
Guess I pushed her
into that pile too.

284
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,699
I spend half my life
waiting on you.

285
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,822
How many times do you
have to change your outfit?

286
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,370
Sorry, Jay. Too many
choices is a prison.

287
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,619
Just drive before
he rethinks the pants.

288
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,913
What's wrong with my pants?
Go, go, go.

289
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,123
So Manny, how'd it go
with the principal today?

290
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:54,505
It was terrible. But he was
brave, and now it's over.

291
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,427
Right, Manny?
Mm-hmm.

292
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,842
So- What'd they give you?
Detention? Suspension?

293
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,424
No, just a warning,
because it was first offense.

294
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,176
So how's work?
Great.

295
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,933
Just a warning, huh?
Like she said.

296
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:09,266
So I ask about work,
and you change the subject.

297
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,851
Are you trying to hide
something?

298
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,686
No. I just want to make sure he's okay.
You okay?

299
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,068
'Cause, I mean, it looks like you're
sweatin' bullets back there, kid.

300
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,866
Stop grilling him. First
the principal, now you.

301
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,785
This poor boy is being
screamed at all day.

302
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,035
Well, now-
Quiet! I've got this.

303
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,162
Where is Lily?

304
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,881
Um, she's getting dressed.
All by herself?

305
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,880
Cam is encouraging her to
be more independent. Oh.

306
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,802
And there she is!

307
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:39,879
Ahh!

308
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,509
Doesn't she look beautiful?

309
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,341
Oh.
Mm-hmm.

310
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,268
She looks like she was dipped in glue
and dragged through a ?ea market.

311
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:47,846
Hey!

312
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,563
Hey.  Hey, guys.

313
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,856
How's it goin'?

314
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:53,230
Hey, do you guys have
any old furniture?

315
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:55,854
I'm moving into the attic.
The attic?

316
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,564
Hey, at least it's big.

317
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,532
Grandpa said you used to
live in a closet. Oh, okay.

318
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,612
Well, you know what? Yeah, we'll absolutely
find you something for sure, okay?

319
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,698
My daddy!
Lily, no!

320
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:09,409
I'm sorry, Luke.
This isn't over.

321
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,745
Oh, my God, Mitchell.
She's getting worse.

322
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:15,082
I have turned her into a pushy
little entitled monster ...

323
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,758
on her way to a rap sheet
and a bracelet on her ankle.

324
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,924
Oh, she has a bracelet
on her ankle. Cam-

325
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:25,892
Cam, this might not be entirely
your fault. No, it is.

326
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:29,888
I spoke with Lily's teacher, and she thinks
that she may have a problem with sharing,

327
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,144
which she might
have gotten from-

328
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:33,816
You. You don't
like to share.

329
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,564
No, I do it to
make a point sometimes.

330
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,566
Like, if you want the chicken,
then order the chicken.

331
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,318
Wait, when did you talk
to Lily's teacher?

332
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,274
Uh, today when I- when I
dropped her off at school.

333
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,030
And you let me suffer
all day?

334
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,578
Look. W-We can't do this
with everybody here.

335
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,405
Can we please just
get through the evening?

336
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,081
Yes, but we are not making
the announcement tonight,

337
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:52,957
because that is a joyful thing, and I
am not feeling very joyful right now.

338
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,629
Well, I share your feeling.
l-

339
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,304
Just so you know, I'm onto you.

340
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,677
You never took Manny
to the principal.

341
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:10,436
Okay, play it like that.
But I know Manny.

342
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,481
He has more of a conscience
than you have.

343
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,274
He's not gonna be able
to live with this.

344
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,820
You'd be surprised what
people can live with, Jay.

345
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,743
Hi, Miss Lily.

346
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,991
How's my big girl doing?
Good.

347
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,038
Can you tell me
how old you are now?

348
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,866
Three!

349
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,293
Well, that's four.
This is three.

350
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,961
Okay, show me again.
How old are you?

351
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,004
Three.

352
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,959
No, that many is four.
This many is three.

353
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,587
Don't argue, Lily. You'll never win.
Really, Phil?

354
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,220
Okay, I-l was going to wait
until we got home for this.

355
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:51,223
But now I think it's something
everyone's gonna enjoy. Guys-

356
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,020
Everybody, come on down
to the TV room.

357
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,814
I've got something
really special to share.

358
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,642
Okay, how's everybody
on drinks?

359
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,194
If this is Alex's graduation
again, just leave me the bottle.

360
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,566
I'm good, Cam.

361
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:06,277
Okay, everybody, showtime.

362
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,282
Oh, my gosh.
it's us at the market.

363
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,996
- Uh-huh. Yeah, it's security camera footage.
- How did you-

364
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,787
I don't understand. What are we watching?
It ain't The Godfather.

365
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,664
Okay, look.
I fell yesterday at the market.

366
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,916
Phil and I have been having a little
disagreement as to what happened.

367
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,292
Just watch.
Okay, right here.

368
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,751
I stop to fix my shoe, and
then Phil- Right there. Okay.

369
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,336
He makes way for this
very attractive woman,

370
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,423
whom he conveniently leaves out
of his retelling of the story.

371
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:33,808
Now, right here, Phil backs up, pushes his
butt into the cart, pushes me into the cans.

372
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,514
Do you see that?
it's all his fault!

373
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:39,601
Just like I said!
I was right! Suck it!

374
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,816
When did you get this?
Oh, my God.

375
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,068
That's why you wanted
to come separately.

376
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:48,321
You went to all that trouble
just to prove you were right?

377
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,119
It really wasn't
that much trouble.

378
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,573
I went to the store, found your friend
Jordan, the bag boy, who got me the manager.

379
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,125
He gave me the address of
the off-site security office.

380
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,202
I filled out some paperwork.
Sally faxed it to corporate.

381
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:02,166
Three minutes later, I'm buying a pack
of DVDs and burning a copy. Cake.

382
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,384
It's like a sickness.

383
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,087
What? None of you believed
me, so I got proof.

384
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,843
You should all be sucking it
right now.

385
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:13,142
Ay, please stop with the "sucking it," Claire.
They're children.

386
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,766
Yes, children are very impressionable.
You'll never know what they'll pick up.

387
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,769
Okay, Cam, I'm sorry that I
blamed it all on you, okay?

388
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,521
But we both need to
look at our actions.

389
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,820
I mean, if we're thinking about
adopting another baby, then we need to-

390
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:27,649
- You're adopting another kid?
- That's not the way you make an announcement!

391
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:30,485
- Banners! Banners!
- Thank you, but it's not a-

392
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,284
# Ah, let's give the boy a hand #
Oh, wow.

393
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,205
What the hell's
happening here?

394
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,783
Is that from Footloose?

395
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,960
- # Let's hear it for my babdy #
- Really, Mitchell?

396
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,999
You couldn't even share telling
your family.

397
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:45,549
- It's fine.
- Why are you upset? This is such good news.

398
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,378
No, we're a little on edge because
Lily has been acting out,

399
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:49,963
like she doesn't want
a sibling-

400
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,390
Yeah, because Mitchell
taught her to hate sharing.

401
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,810
And, or, because Cam wears her
like a fanny pack.

402
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:58,388
Oh, stop blaming each other.
No kid wants a sibling.

403
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:01,771
I mean, Claire hated you so much, she
stuck you in a dryer when you were two.

404
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,226
You put me in the dryer?

405
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,528
I did. But it wasn't
'cause I hated you.

406
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:09,153
My friend Marcie said that it wouldn't run
with a kid inside it, and I knew it would.

407
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,280
- I was right.
- Good governor.

408
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,283
It's been going on
since you were five?

409
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:17,869
Oh, my God, it is a sickness.
Yeah.

410
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:21,919
What would make me have
that need at such a young age?

411
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,496
How long was I in that dryer?
Because-

412
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,252
I-Is this why I'm
afraid of tumbling?

413
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,550
I had to quit gymnastics,
Claire!

414
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,549
A childhood without tumbling?
Oh.

415
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:33,256
You knew this, and just
stood by and did nothing?

416
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,592
Okay, okay.
What's done is done.

417
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,677
All you can do is
learn from your mistakes.

418
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,561
And in that spirit, I would like
to propose a toast to Manny.

419
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,019
This week, he did something he wasn't
supposed to do, like we all do-

420
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,446
Like we all do!
Salud to Manny.

421
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:49,773
Not yet.

422
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,698
But Manny stood up
like a man.

423
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:55,620
He admitted he was wrong, and he took his licks.
And I'm damn proud of him.

424
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,915
- Ah, now we clink.
- No, we clink when I say we clink.

425
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:02,334
So Manny made a mistake, but he
didn't take the easy way out.

426
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:07,667
He's got guts. He's got integrity. And
as far as I'm concerned, he's the best-

427
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,297
Okay, stop, stop!
I didn't do any of that!

428
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:13,888
Mom broke into the locker and threw the necklace
inside, and then we ran away like cowards!

429
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,802
I'm sorry, Jay! I'm sorry!
I knew it.

430
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,975
I was right! I was right!

431
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,766
Ohhhh.

432
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:23,644
Okay. Yup.

433
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,228
Who is it?

434
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,778
Oh, hi, honey.
Just me.

435
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,865
Are you okay?
Yeah. I'm great.

436
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,658
So how are you liking
your new digs?

437
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,244
I know you told me that
I'd be cold- Mm-hmm.

438
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,329
And scared, but I'm not.
Mm-hmm.

439
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:42,375
No, I can see that. I was wrong.

440
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,617
You were.
Yeah.

441
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,499
Well, you're gonna hate this
then, honey,

442
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,582
but I'm gonna need you to go back down
and sleep in your old room.

443
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,837
I just- I'm worried
if you get something so cool ...

444
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,168
this early in your life,

445
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,595
you're not gonna have anything
to look forward to later.

446
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,718
I have to go now?

447
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:59,592
You can spend the rest of the
night here, if you want. Oh, no.

448
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,975
If it's so important to you,
I'll go now.

449
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,816
You should come too.

450
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,393
Something sleeps over there.

451
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:13,907
Wait for me. Wait.
Wait for me. Wait for me.

452
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:16,817
