1
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:06,636
Whoa.
What's all this?

2
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:09,013
- Mom heard us say we were bored.
- Suckers.

3
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:11,311
She heard us from outside.

4
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,639
She has super good hearing,
like a Seeing Eye dog.

5
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:16,942
They have overdeveloped hearing
to make up for the fact-

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,690
Wait. The dogs aren't blind.

7
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,271
Wait. Are they?

8
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,733
No, that wouldn't make sense.

9
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:26,443
You're right. If I wait long enough,
she can get there by herself.

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,414
Quick, girls. Famous
Danny from Moonstruck.

11
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:31,957
Aiello.

12
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,579
Hey, Phil,
I'm glad I caught ya.

13
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:34,706
What's up ?

14
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:36,537
Uh, it's about
Steven and Stefan.

15
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,418
They want' to see that' house
on Briar again.

16
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:39,999
Really? I showed it to 'em five times.

17
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:41,880
Last time we were there,
I think they got mail.

18
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:44,087
Yeah, well, that's why I'm calling.
They hate upsetting people.

19
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:45,671
Unless, of course, it's me.

20
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:48,132
Then they don't mind waking me
at 7:00 a.m., asking me to call you.

21
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,183
It's no problem.
I'm just hanging around.

22
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:51,932
Kind of bored, really.

23
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,513
What?

24
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,644
Well, we did
our good deed for the day.

25
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,942
Yeah, for the enemy.
Don't they have enough?

26
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:02,237
It's been about a year since
we decided to adopt a boy.

27
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:05,816
Meanwhile, our friends Steven and Stefan
decided that they wanted a baby too.

28
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,367
Wonder where
they got that idea.

29
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,036
Well, we're still waiting,
but they already got their kid,

30
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:11,785
because they went through
a surrogate.

31
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,490
Which is all
they talk about.

32
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,868
Are you gonna keep doing that?
I might.

33
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,708
I have to go show a house. But first, what was
Elton John's sexual orientation in the '70s?

34
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,007
Bi.

35
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,051
- You've done that one before.
- And it never gets old.

36
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:27,425
Like the good
Captain Fantastic himself.

37
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:31,058
Hey, Claire, guess what? I'm sorry,
honey, I can't talk right now.

38
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:34,182
I told Bethenny I would take her to the airport.
I'm late, and she's gonna miss her flight.

39
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,184
Where are my keys?
Why is that chair still here?

40
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,391
I thought you and Luke were gonna
put it out on the sidewalk.

41
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:41,101
So you can't talk,
unless it's about my chores.

42
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,528
Why don't you just do it now
and you won't be so bored.

43
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:47,240
You heard that?
I hear everything.

44
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,488
That's for me.

45
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,457
Hey, Leon.
Nice buzz cut.

46
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:58,251
Yeah, for some people,
the shampoo doesn't work.

47
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:00,830
It only makes
the lice angry.

48
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,835
Nice to see you.

49
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,258
Oh, no. No.
Oh, God.

50
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:08,634
Um, Alex, do not move.
Haley, clean this up, okay?

51
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,339
Who fills a vase
with marbles?

52
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,925
Who doesn't see a vase
filled with marbles?

53
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,510
Who wants to hear
a bunch of plates crashing?

54
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:17,142
Phil! Honey, the girls
need you in the kitchen.

55
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,939
Thanks for the hat, Leon.
Kind of tickles.

56
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,733
Phil!

57
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,311
How much electricity
do we need to bring this back?

58
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,398
It's not rocket science. We're
only reanimating a squirrel.

59
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,700
Phil! Now!

60
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,285
# Hey, hey #

61
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,409
# Hey, hey #

62
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,490
# Hey, hey #

63
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,450
# Hey, hey #

64
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,705
# Hey ##

65
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,711
Sounds great.
No, hang on.

66
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,292
Gloria, where's Manny?

67
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,594
Some neighborhood kids have
invited him to play football.

68
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,138
He said he was taking
his morning constitutional.

69
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:53,682
He's workin' on his go-kart,
but he'll be there.

70
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,555
Okay, see you then.

71
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:58,353
No, Manny cannot
go and play with those boys.

72
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,227
Margo is trying to get us
theater tickets for this afternoon.

73
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,933
Gloria, you and Manny
do enough together.

74
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,893
Let's let him decide.
Where's he walking?

75
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,604
I don't know. But according to
the song he was singing,

76
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,736
he was going to
the sunny side of the street.

77
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:13,194
I cannot express to you enough
how bad this kid needs football.

78
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,619
Mom, look what I found!

79
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,663
Number 99!

80
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,241
When Manny was five,
we didn't have much,

81
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,826
we were on our own,

82
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,957
so we always dreamed
of winning the lottery.

83
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,165
We figured if we collected
100 lucky heads-up pennies ...

84
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,501
and bought a ticket with them,
we couldn't lose.

85
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:32,508
But now, I have a wonderful
husband, a beautiful home.

86
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,056
I feel like I already
won the lottery.

87
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,305
So I can keep
whatever we win?

88
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:40,012
I think no.
I found most of them.

89
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,482
Can you put this in the jar
with the others?

90
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,153
A y, I forgot. What is the
combination to your safe?

91
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,199
Uh-
I'll just come with you.

92
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:55,244
Oh, yes, 'cause that's how this arrangement works.
I take money from you.

93
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,081
Hello.

94
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,535
Oh, hi, Margo. No, no,
she just ran upstairs.

95
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,619
Listen, about these
theater tickets.

96
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:08,207
Don't knock yourself out
tryin' to- Oh, you did.

97
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,009
Well, sorry to do this last minute,
but they can't go.

98
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,049
No, Manny has a football game,
so-

99
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:16,177
Jay, could you steep my tea?

100
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:21,224
I cannot express to you enough
how much this kid needs football.

101
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:25,900
And that is the whole house.
Again.

102
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,318
I love it,
but I just don't love it.

103
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,688
Do you love it? I love it.
I absolutely love it.

104
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:34,191
I'm just not sure if I'm
in love with it. Oh, yeah.

105
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,699
We have an expression around the office
for when a sale just isn't happening-

106
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,826
commission impossible.

107
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,537
Maybe for some people.

108
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,539
Not sure if I mentioned it
before,

109
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:48,334
but the house does come with a hookup
for a European washing machine.

110
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,790
Oh, I love that.

111
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:53,503
Oh, so sorry.

112
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,671
It's the boss.

113
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,341
- Hey.
- Hi. I'm on my way home.

114
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:02,052
I've been calling Haley, but nobody's answering.
ls everything okay there?

115
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,183
Everything here is great.

116
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,390
Oh, thank God. Did you
put the chair out front?

117
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:09,018
Not yet. Honey, you're gonna
miss the trash pickup.

118
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,852
Don't worry. if they don't
take it, someone else will.

119
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:13,439
Who is gonna pick up
that ratty chair off our lawn?

120
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,195
Are you kidding?
It's in great shape.

121
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,822
Super cozy. People are
always commenting on it.

122
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,995
Trust me, it'll be gone
by the end of the day.

123
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,947
- Please just do it now.
- I can't.

124
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,532
I'm so sorry.

125
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,788
When I'm done with these clients,
I'll call Luke and Leon.

126
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,494
I know I can
talk them into it.

127
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,454
We are not losing this house
to Luke and Leon.

128
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:32,382
What do you mean, "call Luke and Leon"?
Aren't you at home?

129
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,879
No, I left
right before you did.

130
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:37,429
Phil, the hou-
The-The kids.

131
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,006
Oh, God, the squirrel.

132
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,763
Hello?

133
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,310
We'll take it.

134
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,932
Oh.

135
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,606
Commission ... accomplished.

136
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,821
So how great is your life right now, huh?
A new house, new baby.

137
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,773
Stefan's Propecia's kicking in.

138
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,861
Oh. That's him.
He's on his way.

139
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:03,368
He texted "O.M.W." We try to keep our texts
short when we're driving with the baby.

140
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,494
Oh, well, what wonderful
parents you are.

141
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:08,043
You guys hate us
a little bit, don't you?

142
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,127
No. God, no.
Yeah, just a little.

143
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,420
Have you thought
about surrogacy?

144
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,248
At least you'd be
making a baby,

145
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,426
instead of waiting around for some
pregnant morn to maybe pick you.

146
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,754
Well, we considered it, but how
do you decide which one will-

147
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,176
Where's Lily?
Sleeping.

148
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,256
Ice the cupcake?

149
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,137
That you couldn't
say in front of Lily?

150
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:24,976
Well, then she'd want a cupcake.
Yeah.

151
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,725
- But that's the beauty of the swirl.
- The swirl?

152
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,648
You both donate.
They mix it up, fertilize the egg,

153
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,772
you never know
who the father is.

154
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,853
Ooh, that's Stefan.

155
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,940
You know, maybe we should
think about the swirl.

156
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:41,243
Well, I-l didn't think Surrogacy
was for us, but, you know-

157
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,991
'Cause one of us would
feel left out.

158
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,867
Yeah, but if you don't know
whose it is-

159
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:48,826
Sorry we're late.
Guys, meet Rocco.

160
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,378
Rocco or cocoa?

161
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:58,173
- Look at him out there.
- Oh, honey, this is so exciting.

162
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:02,843
Go ahead! Attaboy!

163
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,511
Go! Go ahead!
Go, Manny! Run!

164
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,845
I knew Gloria would find out
I lied about those tickets,

165
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,272
but I figured
when she saw Manny out there,

166
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,442
playing with all those other
kids, she'd thank me.

167
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,686
That's what I figured.

168
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,146
Go, go!

169
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,944
What the hell's he doin'?
Run, Manny, run!

170
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,242
Mom, number 100!
Now we have the money-

171
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,708
Oh, thank God.
Nobody's dead.

172
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,715
Or we're all dead.

173
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,047
- How many plates did we lose?
- None.

174
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,757
Luke and Haley used cookie sheets to
clear a path through the marbles for me.

175
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,184
- Where are the marbles?
- Right here.

176
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,512
- Oh, Haley!
- I put glue on 'em so it doesn't happen again.

177
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:53,974
- What about the chair?
- Leon and I rolled it outside on some skateboards.

178
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,901
Oh.  The squirrel.

179
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,900
You think I was going to
let that happen?

180
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:04,693
These kids are going to survive.
They are the best of me and Phil.

181
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:09,407
Luke using the skateboards, Haley
gluing the marbles- That is pure Phil.

182
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,993
Alex keeping everyone in line?
Pure me.

183
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:18,377
Sometimes I worry
no one's gonna like Alex.

184
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,884
There you go, buddy.
Thank you.

185
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,178
Uh- What? You need anything?
I'll get it.

186
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,385
Steak sauce.
But it's okay.

187
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,014
It's probably good for me
to move around.

188
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:38,568
Oh, Jay, it's so nice to see you
take care of him like that.

189
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,312
Why are you surprised? He's our kid.

190
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,363
We take care of each other
in this family.

191
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,317
I want to kill you.

192
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,825
Wild guess- Margo.
Let me explain.

193
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,031
There is no excuse.

194
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,287
This is sounding private.
I'm gonna get out of here.

195
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,460
So that's why you were
being so nice.

196
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,333
You lied
to my friend.

197
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,585
You made Manny
play the American football.

198
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,837
It is your fault that
he got stampeded.

199
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,427
Or is it your fault?

200
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,470
He stopped to pick up a penny,
for God's sake.

201
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,173
Be careful
what you say, Jay.

202
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:11,305
You're skating on thin
eggshells right now.

203
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,432
I tried to get him out there
with kids his own age,

204
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,146
which is what he should
be doin'-

205
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,973
And not spending another
afternoon with his mommy.

206
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:20,652
If you have a problem with the way
Manny's being raised, you talk to me!

207
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,271
I am. I don't want to hear it!

208
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,117
Phil, you really
didn't have to do this.

209
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:34,575
I sold a house today because of you two.
The least I can do is buy you dinner.

210
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,375
I saw that house.
It is gorgeous.

211
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,044
I know. Yes. We're
real happy for them.

212
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,918
They showed me a picture of the baby.
How adorable is that little guy?

213
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,125
Yes, we're real happy
for them.

214
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,381
Okay, you might want to
slow down there.

215
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,962
I'm playing
a new drinking game.

216
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,594
It's called "Every time I'm depressed,
I take a drink."

217
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,891
That game exists.
It's called alcoholism.

218
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,310
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're right.

219
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,729
I'm-I'm wallowing,
and it's not cute.

220
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,148
- To happier things.
- Yes.

221
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,186
To happier things.
Happier things.

222
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,650
There you go. Yes.

223
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,399
I remember the first few drinks,

224
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:06,903
and, urn, after that, the
night's just bits and pieces.

225
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:11,327
I want to do something I never
do- brag about my kids.

226
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:15,623
Today, they were resourceful.
They were responsible. They-

227
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,450
Put 40% down.

228
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:20,083
It was worth showing the house
five times and waiting-

229
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,961
Almost a year. Seriously!
Who do you have to-

230
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,260
Blow. That's really hot. Why don't you
let it cool down and try some of the-

231
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:30,088
Mexican! The baby
is clearly Mexican.

232
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,139
So, you know,
the swirl is out.

233
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:34,513
Oh, it's enough
to make you lose-

234
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:38,847
Track. Is this my fourth
drink, or is it my fourth?

235
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:42,272
I just said fourth twice, didn't I?
I did, didn't I?

236
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:46,150
I think we're gonna need four cabs.
Two! Two!

237
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,776
You made me!

238
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:52,407
L-I vaguely remember
someone crying.

239
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,988
If we ever did surrogacy, I
would want you to be the donor.

240
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,161
Mm-mmm. You're so smart.
You're so handsome.

241
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,663
Oh, stop it. It should be you.
You're so fun.

242
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,291
- You're so talented.
- Okay.

243
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,840
It's not fair.
I love you both so much.

244
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:09,840
If you could have a baby that was a mix of the
two of you, I would love that baby so much.

245
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,092
- Stop it.
- Oh, that is so sweet.

246
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,558
I meant it.
That is so sweet.

247
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,011
Oh, my God, you guys,
we could do this.

248
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:23,225
We could do this. We could make a baby
that is half Tucker and half Pritchett.

249
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:26,107
Are you saying what I think
you're saying?

250
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,275
Yeah.
Cloning?

251
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:32,655
No, no. I'm saying ...
I give the egg.

252
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,236
Oh!

253
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,447
Yeah, I give the egg.
That's the Pritchett side.

254
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,783
And then Cam,
you're the father, right?

255
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:44,542
And then we just, like, mix it and put
it in a- like, a surrogate lady thing,

256
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,498
and then, bang,
we have a baby.

257
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:49,718
Oh! Are-Are you serious?
You would do that?

258
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,591
I would be honored.
You guys.

259
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,674
You guys, if there's one
thing I have learned today,

260
00:11:55,757 --> 00:12:00,012
it's the pleasure of looking at
your children and seeing both-

261
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,596
both of you in there,

262
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,556
and I want you to have
that experience.

263
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,517
- We need that. We want that.
- Yeah.

264
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,147
And something else.

265
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:10,948
- Guys, I make really good babies.
- Yes.

266
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,691
- I have magic eggs or something.
- Yes.

267
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,027
- They're, like, golden.
- Oh, gosh.

268
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,658
Oh, Phil, I don't- What do you-
What do you say about this?

269
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,330
I think we're all
having a baby!

270
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,745
Table hug!

271
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:26,622
Sweet potato fries!

272
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,677
What have I done?
I know.

273
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:33,799
Oh.

274
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,383
What was I thinking?

275
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,764
I just get drunk, and I bring
a baby into the world?

276
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,311
That would be
four for four.

277
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,355
I can't go through with it.

278
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,603
Don't panic. You haven't
donated anything yet.

279
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,562
Besides, what are the chances
your eggs even work?

280
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,817
What are the chances we can
pretend I never said that?

281
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,240
It's weird.
it's my brother.

282
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,615
And then there would be this baby over there
that's my baby, but it's not my baby-

283
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,537
That actually sounds good.
Just say that.

284
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,831
We're gonna see 'em for brunch
in two hours over at your dad's.

285
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:06,457
Ooh, that seems soon ...
and-and hard.

286
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,464
What if- What if
I blame it on you?

287
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,918
What if we say that
you're not okay with it?

288
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,423
" No!

289
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,051
Are you really okay with another
man fertilizing your wife's egg?

290
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,178
- Of course not. That's creepy.
- Yes.

291
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,760
Plus, what if you and Cam make
a better baby than we did?

292
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:25,313
It's settled.
Phil says no.

293
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,732
Like they're really gonna
believe that I overruled you.

294
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,351
Oh, right.
Come on.

295
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,903
Mmm.
They're gonna be crushed.

296
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,730
They've waited so long
for this baby.

297
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,362
Maybe they're having
second thoughts too.

298
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,570
Look. This is what my baby
with Claire would look like.

299
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,075
What is this? What?

300
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:45,876
Okay, well, I found a Web site
where couples can upload pictures,

301
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,580
and then it shows 'em what their
baby would look like.

302
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,630
This is Gloria and I.

303
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:54,084
Couldn't resist.
Wow.

304
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,885
That-That looks
exactly like Manny.

305
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,088
Like-Like weirdly so.

306
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,639
Wait, what's
this other picture?

307
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,512
Don't be jealous.

308
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:05,061
But this is me
and Justin Timberlake.

309
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,231
Cam, we have a problem.

310
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:11,568
Oh, what, you can talk about Ryan Gosling
all day, but the moment I say something-

311
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,315
No, no, no.
About this baby.

312
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,863
I don't think I can do it.

313
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,737
What? Why?
Why? it's perfect.

314
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,035
It's our chance to have a baby
that's part me, part you.

315
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,238
No, no, it's part you
and part Claire.

316
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,824
I'm nowhere in there. And
it's not like I can pretend.

317
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:28,911
It's- She's not some egg donor
that we don't know. it's Claire.

318
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,870
You know, we see her
all the time.

319
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:34,207
And what are we supposed to tell the baby?
"Say hi to your Aunt Mommy."

320
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,884
- Adorable.
- No, not adorable.

321
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:37,960
Appalachian.

322
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,260
Okay, I'm-I'm sorry, Cam.

323
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:48,684
Jay says that I'm smothering
Manny, but I'm just enjoying him.

324
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,936
I mean, they're only gonna
be boys for a short time.

325
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:54,394
Best time ever
in this house!

326
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,195
I'm uncomfortable
with this, Phil.

327
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,364
The manual specifically
says "No towing."

328
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,487
There are two types
of people in this world-

329
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,490
people who follow the manual and
people who stick it to the manu-

330
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,661
That hurt!

331
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,035
Hi.

332
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,368
- Manny, what happened?
- Football injury.

333
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,623
My mom will "yell" you
all about it.

334
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:16,458
Hola, Lily. Does my little
princess want a cookie?

335
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,009
Oh, well, you know,
maybe just one.

336
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,595
She's already had her sugar limit for today.
How can you tell?

337
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,806
¡Ay! Okay, Lily.

338
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,601
Hey.
Hey, you two.

339
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,099
So, where-
Oh, where are the kids?

340
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,021
Oh, Haley's driving them
over separately.

341
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,599
Ohh.
Big girl now.

342
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:33,649


343
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,858
That's right.  Yeah.

344
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,528
So, that was
so fun last night.

345
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,068
So fun. Yeah. We
had a great night.

346
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:41,900
Yes.

347
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,200
We should get that-

348
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,278
Jinx.

349
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,908
We're goin' this way, so-
350 for 30.

350
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:48,831
See you in a bit.
That looks delicious.

351
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,835
I cannot tell them.

352
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,420
I cannot break their hearts.

353
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,915
So you're gonna have Cam's baby just
to keep things from being weird?

354
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,000
Um, what?

355
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,131
You and Uncle Cam
are having a baby?

356
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:05,135
Kids, shh. There was a discussion about the
possibility of your mom donating an egg ...

357
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,761
so that the guys
could have a baby.

358
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,764
But we decided
it was not a good idea.

359
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,641
Why? Because
Lily's such a mess?

360
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,722
For a lot of reasons.
They have to-

361
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,274
But we can agree that she's a
disaster as a human being.

362
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,478
- I think it's a great idea.
- Yeah.

363
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:21,656
It's a really beautiful offer, Mom.
I'm impressed.

364
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,733
Oh, my God. Cam!

365
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,695
They told the kids already, and
they seem to be totally into it.

366
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,200
Is it just me? Am I the only
one that thinks this is weird?

367
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:33,702
Maybe it's not weird. Maybe we're pioneers.
No, we're hardly pioneers.

368
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,878
You have three different hair dryers
for different types of weather.

369
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,126
Maybe it's just gonna take some
time to get used to the idea.

370
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,669
What idea?
Oh.

371
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,126
Um, well, Jay-

372
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,877
Cam.
Claire has-

373
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,089
No. I- I just don't think my dad's
really ready for this conversation, so-

374
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,300
Stop acting like
I'm some stodgy old coot.

375
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,180
I've grown.  Okay.

376
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:55,265
Um, Jay, Claire has offered
to give us one of her eggs,

377
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:58,443
so we can have a baby that's
half Pritchett, half Tucker.

378
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,192
That's unnatural.
I'm against it.

379
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,865
Oh, surprise, surprise.
Jay's against something.

380
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,909
Cam and Claire want to
have a baby together.

381
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,658
Eww!
You're not gonna do that.

382
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,159
It's not
your decision, Dad.

383
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,157
You're not thinking straight.
And you're not in charge.

384
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,743
Okay, Claire and I
are adults.

385
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,203
If we want this to happen,
it's-it's gonna happen.

386
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,129
So much for second thoughts.

387
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,957
Young lady, I need to
have a talk with you.

388
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:23,835
I don't- Now?  No!

389
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:27,013
You don't get to tell everyone
how to live their lives,

390
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:29,887
that boys cannot spend time
with their mommies ...

391
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:32,469
or that brothers and sister
can't make babies.

392
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:36,769
So you're all for this? No, it's a
freak show, but it's their freak show.

393
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,101
So this is
happening again.

394
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,983
Well, I'm not gonna not do it
'cause my dad thinks I shouldn't.

395
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:46,108
I'm not following. We're not doing
it 'cause I don't want to do it.

396
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,160
What we're not doing is not doing it
'cause he doesn't want us to do it!

397
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:50,904
Just say baby or no baby.

398
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,490
Isn't it enough this family
spends a lot of time together?

399
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,041
Now we have to inbreed.

400
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:58,040
Okay, Dad. it's not technically
inbreeding. it's, um-

401
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:01,544
For the record, I think what
my mom is doing is very brave.

402
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:04,876
I like it. I've always kind of
wanted a half-brother, half-cousin.

403
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,757
- Really? Always?
- I mean, if you think about it-

404
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,721
I disagree
with you about inbreeding, young lady.

405
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,676
I would like to make a small presentation.
If everyone could-

406
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,352
Once the neighbors find out,
and they will-

407
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:22,352
Oh, wow. When was the last
time we talked under a table?

408
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:26,026
Dad and Gloria's wedding reception.
Oh, yeah.

409
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,573
Um, mmm-

410
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,197
I love you. You know that.
But I can't do this.

411
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,161
No, no, neither can I.
Really?

412
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,576
Yeah. Are you serious?
You can't-

413
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,123
Oh, God, I'm so relieved.
I'm sorry.

414
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,748
L-I- Oh, I am so sorry
I led us down this road.

415
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,329
No, no, Claire.
Don't be. Don't be.

416
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:44,916
It was generous and thoughtful,
just like you.

417
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,297
How could I not want
those qualities in my child?

418
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,716
Ohh.
Oh, come here.

419
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,885
Good brother. So this
is really happening?

420
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:55,055
What if it is, Dad? Yeah, what if we love
each other and this is a beautiful thing?

421
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:57,053
Okay, it's our decision.
it's not yours. Yeah.

422
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,184
So- baby, no baby?

423
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,433
No.
Mm-mmm.

424
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,939
You okay?
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

425
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:10,275
Oh, I know
it's been hard on you.

426
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,235
Hey, what if we went out
for a nice dinner tonight?

427
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,033
Oh, that'd be fun. Should
I call the sitter? Yeah.

428
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,829
You know what I was thinking today?
What about Luke?

429
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,203
Oh, he's so good with her,
the way he looks at her.

430
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,743
Oh, my God, Cam.
Oh.

431
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,079
She's organizing
her things.

432
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:24,706
Look at how she's dressed.
Oh.

433
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,381
We didn't make her,
but she sure is us.

434
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,304
Hey, Lily. It might make
more sense with the shoes-

435
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,882
Mitchell.

436
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,261
I like what she did with the dolls though.
Play as you will.

437
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,059
It's nice.
Play as you will.

438
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,101
The bent one, remember?
One of the first ones we found.

439
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,107
It was at the bottom
of the gutter in the street.

440
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:51,407
A y, yes. We put the gum at the
bottom of your walking stick.

441
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,075
Ay, look at this one,
the green one.

442
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,370
- The one we found at the floor of my taxi.
- Your taxi?

443
00:19:56,445 --> 00:20:02,123
Yes. Before I had somebody running my life
for me, I used to drive a taxi at night.

444
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,624
Manny would sleep
in the seat next to me.

445
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,706
One time, I had to hit
the brakes so hard ...

446
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:09,633
that he fell into the floor,
and he found the penny.

447
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,507
Pretty lucky, huh?

448
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,929
Eight years. I can't believe
we're finally done.

449
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,475
Me, either.

450
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,429
Come. Let's go
get your lottery ticket.

451
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,524
Gloria, I think you
made a mistake here.

452
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,105
What did I do now?

453
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,941
I've counted these, and
you've only got 96 pennies.

454
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,776
Are you sure?

455
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,533
'Fraid so.

456
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,080
I guess you're gonna
have to keep lookin'.

457
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,409
Dang it!
I counted those.

458
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,789
See for yourself.

459
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,883
And now we upload
your picture.

460
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,589
This is fun.
This is fun.

461
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:59,551
Yeah. And in just a few short moments,
thanks to the magic of technology,

462
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,260
we'll know what our
baby actually looks like.

463
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,012
No, no.
What happened? What is that?

464
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,847
Did you put one of us in
upside down?

465
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,434
No, that's actually- Okay, I don't
want to see this anymore. Turn it off.

466
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,403
Oh, it's not turning off. Throw
something over it, then. Oh, God!

467
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:13,481
Yeah, well, we played God,
and look what we brought forth.

468
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:15,066
Daddies,
what are you looking at?

469
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,867
- Maybe it wasn't that bad.
- No, no.

470
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,414
It's possible that
we overreacted.

471
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,709
Yeah. Maybe our expectations
were just a little too high.

472
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,377
The little guy had some
cute features, huh?

473
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,079
Of course he did. it's us.

474
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:29,755
It can't be that bad.
Let's just take a-

475
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,379
English - US - PSDH
