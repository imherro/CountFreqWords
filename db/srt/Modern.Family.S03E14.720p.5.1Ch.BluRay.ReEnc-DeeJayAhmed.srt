1
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:04,963
Oh, I hope Tad likes salmon.

2
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:06,845
It's a bit of a risk
serving fish ...

3
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:08,471
to a first-time diner
at Dunphy's.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,552
Maybe I should marinate
a steak for backup.

5
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:12,434
I think someone
has a man crush.

6
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:14,515
First of all, I would never
date a potential client.

7
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,145
That's first of all.

8
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:18,944
Secondly, I really need this to go
well so he makes me his Realtor.

9
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,068
This guy's flippin' properties like
they're extras in a kung fu movie.

10
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,990
So you're just kissing up
to this guy for his money.

11
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:25,534
Not just.
I really like him.

12
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:29,409
He travels the world doing charity
work, rock climbs, flies planes.

13
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:31,411
How does he have time
to do all that?

14
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,367
Got divorced
and his whole life opened up.

15
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,293
Guy's livin' the dream.

16
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:39,415
His dream. Not my dream.

17
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:40,966
I'm living my dream.

18
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,801
You're my dream.
You can stop.

19
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,379
I so don't want to do this.

20
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,511
Recently, Haley got a little creative
on one of her college applications ...

21
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,184
and listed herself
as a Big Sister.

22
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,683
Technically,
I am a big sister.

23
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,605
She capitalized
the "B" and the

24
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:57,683
Which makes sense,
'cause it was.

25
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:00,357
So Claire and I
suggested that- Forced.

26
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:03,609
That she volunteer
for the organization.

27
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:06,033
We couldn't be prouder.

28
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:08,156
We could. A little bit.

29
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,613
Hey, Dad, did you
accidentally leave ...

30
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:13,245
this hilarious book of lawyer
jokes in the guest room?

31
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,121
I'll tell you if you can
answer the following question:

32
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,204
What's the difference between
a catfish and a lawyer?

33
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:19,288
I don't know. What?

34
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:21,248
Well, one's
a bottom-feeding mud dweller.

35
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,833
The other's a fish.

36
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,419
Zing! Aaah.

37
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:28,423
Okay, everyone, dinner is served.
Let's get it.

38
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,132
Our house is being fumigated,
so Jay and Gloria ...

39
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,263
invited us to stay here
for a few days.

40
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,095
I'm very excited to have 72 hours
with this one.

41
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,805
We don't get to spend
much time together,

42
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:40,893
so I know that we're
gonna be like, um- um-

43
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:43,362
Fred and Ginger? Who?

44
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,700
Movie night!

45
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,245
It's noisier than usual
around here.

46
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:54,369
Oh, gosh.

47
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:57,125
# Hey, hey #

48
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,248
# Hey, hey #

49
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:01,251
# Hey, hey #

50
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,173
# Hey, hey #

51
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,716
# Hey ##

52
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,679
Tad, this wine is fantastic.

53
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,257
Spend a week in Mendoza,

54
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,513
and you'll find a dozen
or so Malbec producers ...

55
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,854
that'll give most Bordeaux a
real run for their money. Hmm.

56
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,225
I'm sorry.

57
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:21,354
"May cause pretentiousness."

58
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:24,312
"May be fascinating."

59
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,771
Oh!
Oh, gosh.

60
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,573
Oh, that's like the ninth time
this screw has popped out.

61
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:31,323
Oh, you know what? I need the angled screwdriver.
I left it at the office.

62
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:35,201
I, um- I keep it there
because of all my signs.

63
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,907
I'll, uh, put up
a "for sale" sign,

64
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:40,036
and next day, of course, I gotta
put up that "sold" banner. Yeah.

65
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,586
Then next day, same deal.

66
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,171
For sale, sold. Mm-hmm.

67
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:46,045
For sale, sold. For sale, sold.
Great, great salesman.

68
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,588
I'm getting that.
For sale, sold.

69
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,137
Right. Listen, I gotta
go relieve the babysitter.

70
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:54,342
My ex-wife took 50% of my stuff
and left me 100% of my kids.

71
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,059
They're great.

72
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,929
Hey, listen, um, thank you
so much for coming. Yeah.

73
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,686
Oh, no, thank you, Phil,
so much for the salmon ...

74
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,518
and the steak and the
chicken and the shrimp.

75
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,069
I mean, it was all just delicious.
Great.

76
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,609
This guy is very lucky
to have you. Oh.

77
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,741
Okay. Thanks.
Yeah.

78
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,658
All right.

79
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,205
Let me grab that.

80
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,120
Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.

81
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,792
- Did you see that?
- A handshake that almost became a hug?

82
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,590
Yeah, I saw it. I lived it.
I think I'm in.

83
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,259
No, honey.
He kissed me on the lips.

84
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,879
Another good sign!
it's not a good sign.

85
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,714
Sweetie, you don't think
that's weird?

86
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,391
The guy's a world traveler. He
has a time-share in Costa Rica.

87
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,809
That's probably
how they do it there.

88
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,307
Oh, no, honey.
it felt like he lingered.

89
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,481
It's a progressive culture.

90
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,058
Most of 'em travel
by zip line.

91
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,484
Mmm.

92
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,236
Biscuits and gravy?

93
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:51,611
Yep. My grandma Bitsy's secret
recipe, given to her ...

94
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,864
by her housekeeper, Delilah, who
raised her and was her best friend.

95
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,866
Kind of like The Help,
except Delilah was white,

96
00:03:56,945 --> 00:04:00,415
and was actually herself
quite the racist.

97
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,537
Eat up.

98
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:02,959
Good morning!

99
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:03,998
Hi, Mom.
Hi, sweetheart.

100
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,330
Ah. Where did those come from?

101
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:09,166
- Yeah, I thought amaryllis were out of season.
- Oh, I got a guy.

102
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,752
You know, I just thought they'd
brighten up the house a little bit.

103
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,837
Oh, that was so thoughtful
of you.

104
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,094
I didn't realize that my house
needed brightening up.

105
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:18,517
There she is!

106
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,265
Gloria, Gloria!
¡Ay!

107
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,061
Let me fix your hair.

108
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:25,186
Oh, well, isn't that sweet.

109
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,439
I didn't realize
her hair was broken.

110
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,737
Oh, that smells delicious,
but nothing for me.

111
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,280
I've got
an early work lunch.

112
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,575
Really? I didn't hear an ambulance.

113
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,449
Yeah, it's funny because it's
what I've dedicated my life to.

114
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,576
Oh, is this that meeting with
the deejay with the funny name?

115
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,123
- Booker Bell.
- Booker Bell.

116
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,951
- Booker Bell?
- Everybody now!

117
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,786
Booker Bell was only
the greatest deejay ...

118
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,496
in the history
of drive time radio.

119
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,581
Yeah, well, now he has some
wetlands that developers want,

120
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,632
and we're trying to get him
to donate for preservation.

121
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,461
When I was on the road selling,
I used to listen to Booker all the time.

122
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,262
He practically invented
the prank phone call.

123
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,633
Okay. Wish me luck. Good luck, sweetie.

124
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,686
Booker would play a prank, the sucker
would be twisting in the wind,

125
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,354
and just when you couldn't
stand it anymore,

126
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,773
he'd say, "Guess who just got
their Bell rung?"

127
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,358
God, I'd love to meet him.

128
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,481
Oh, they're just goin' down to Ray's.
You should pop down.

129
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,696
I'm sure he'd love to meet a fan.
I don't know.

130
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:16,113
I met Boz Scaggs once. Got all tongue-tied.
Oh, you'll be fine.

131
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,614
Oh- Oh, Lily,
it's time for school, sweetie.

132
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,363
Oh, I can take her.
Yay! Yay!

133
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,790
Oh. That'd be great.

134
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,118
Yeah, that'd give me some more
time to clean the kitchen.

135
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,044
Maybe do a little dusting.

136
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,747
- Delicious, Cam.
- Mm-hmm.

137
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,419
Annie was amazing.

138
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,800
So funny and cute and sweet.

139
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,348
- Yeah, you've said.
- She made this for me last night.

140
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,925
Look how she signs her name ...

141
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,806
with that big loopy

142
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,058
I'm totally going to frame this.

143
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,105
I made this for Haley
four years ago.

144
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,980
You think this got framed?

145
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,609
She tossed it
in the garbage-

146
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:58,409
right after she wrote "Mrs. Haley Jonas
Brothers" on it, like, 30 times.

147
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,654
The tax write-off alone
makes financial sense,

148
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,579
you know, even if you take
the environment out of it.

149
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,157
Well, don't take
the environment out of it.

150
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,163
Without the wetlands,
there's no ducks.

151
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:09,210
Without the ducks, there's
nothing for me to shoot at.

152
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,209
Okay, well, we're shootin'
from two different angles,

153
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,962
but, uh, hopefully we'll
end up at the same place.

154
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,417
Mitch.
Dad.

155
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,549
I just had to stop down
and meet this guy.

156
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,096
Booker Bell,
I'm Boz Scaggs-

157
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,765
No, I mean- Jay
Pritchett, damn it!

158
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,684
- It's nice to meet you.
- This is such an honor.

159
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,556
- You are hands-down my favorite radio personality of all time.
- That's kind of you to say.

160
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,106
Okay. Well, thanks
for stopping by, Dad.

161
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,396
I gotta tell you one thing.
I'll see you back at the house.

162
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,274
One time, when I was driving
from Youngstown to Sugar Creek,

163
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,401
you called this guy
at a kitty litter company ...

164
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,357
and you asked him to bring
over 900 pounds of litter.

165
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:42,536
And in the background, you heard
all these lions roarin' and-

166
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,409
L- I laughed so hard,
I almost had an accident.

167
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,664
The car or you?

168
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:54,540
Funny as ever.
Anyway-

169
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,375
Hey, are you still in touch
with the old gang?

170
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,176
Grandma Groovy?
Spaceman Clyde?

171
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,629
- Are you kiddin'? I am the old gang.
- No way.

172
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:03,215
I may be old,
but I still know how to boogie.

173
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,891
My God, it's like she's here!

174
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:06,601
She is here.

175
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,470
How are you still not getting this?

176
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,563
That's her.
Excuse me for a second.

177
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,483
What are you doing?
What? I'm a fan.

178
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,104
I came down to say hi.
This is a business meeting.

179
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,610
Do you have any idea
how inappropriate this is?

180
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,862
No. No, of course you don't, because
as far as you're concerned,

181
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:25,242
all a lawyer does is walk into a
bar with a rabbi and a polar bear.

182
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:30,242
Grizzly, 'cause otherwise, when the
bartender says- Dad, I'm working!

183
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,544
You're embarrassing both of us.
Please, you gotta go.

184
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:36,131
All right, I didn't realize that.
Yeah. Yeah, you didn't.

185
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,674
I'm sorry. Go.

186
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,343
Hey.

187
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,680
Hey, where's my stalker? Oh, he's gone.
Got rid of him.

188
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:45,928
Sorry that
he attacked you like that.

189
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,556
Attacked? Nah. I don't mind a
little smoke up my bloomers.

190
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,104
Well, I just thought since
this was a business meeting-

191
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:54,558
And you thought maybe having somebody
make me feel good would wreck it?

192
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,315
There's-There's been a lot of
tension between me and my dad.

193
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,396
I'm actually staying
at his house, and it's just-

194
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,698
Oh, so you chased away
a man who's opened his home to you.

195
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,859
I get the sense
that I'm losing you.

196
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,196
Could I talk
to Grandma Groovy?

197
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,121
Honey, I'm home.

198
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,165
Well, I didn't expect you
so early, dear.

199
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,618
What? You?

200
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:15,170
Yeah, look who came by
to fix the table.

201
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,667
Well, I had some time
to kill,

202
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:19,337
so I thought I'd drop by with
that tool your wife needed. Mmm.

203
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,295
- Wow. What a guy.
- Mm-hmm. He also brought some wine.

204
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,175
Well, you said you liked it
last night,

205
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:26,097
so I had a couple
extra bottles lyin' around-

206
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,346
Boy, do you know the way to this gal's heart

207
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:32,179
I didn't just come here to fix your
table and get your wife drunk.

208
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:35,482
I actually decided to give you that
listing on the Sycamore property.

209
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,810
- Really? That's great.
- Yeah.

210
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,690
Why don't you come over
for dinner tonight ...

211
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,397
and, uh, we'll work out all
the details- One entrée.

212
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,774
Okay.
Claire, you should come too.

213
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,117
Oh, no, no. No, no. If it's
business, I'm- I insist.

214
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,694
He insists. We'll be there.
We're coming.

215
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,450
Shall we say, uh, 7:00?

216
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,164
7:00 sounds great.
Okay.

217
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,707
All right.

218
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,284
I'll let myself out.
Okay.

219
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,248
Wow.

220
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,798
Wow is right.

221
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,883
Mm-hmm.
I just got Sycamore,

222
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,633
a house that sells itself
and gives me the commission.

223
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,931
How does that not bother you?

224
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,508
Claire, it's an expression.

225
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,719
There's work.
Inspections, appraisals-

226
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:15,146
He brought me wine. He took his
shirt off when you weren't here.

227
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,895
Um, he brought us wine, and it doesn't
look super-vacuumed down there.

228
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,442
I'm surprised
he kept his pants on.

229
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,360
Okay. Okay. I can see
what's going on.

230
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,063
You're just so focused
on getting his business ...

231
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,069
that you don't see what's
going on in front of you.

232
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,239
Okay. Now I do see what's going on.
What?

233
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,032
Come here, pretty girl.
What?

234
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,864
You are, you know.
You don't hear it enough.

235
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:37,669
The other night, when you put on
makeup, I was like, "There she is."

236
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,246
Oh, my God.

237
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,798
You think I'm making this up
as some part of an ego boost?

238
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,376
Do you realize
how insulting that is?

239
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,050
What are you doing?

240
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,597
Helping my little sister
with her homework.

241
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,766
That seems ... mean.

242
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:56,267
Annie, this is Alex- that other
sister I was telling you about.

243
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,144
Hi. So nice to meet you.

244
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,726
Um, if you're going
to study there,

245
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,982
you might need to correct
numbers seven through 10.

246
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:06,190
This bed has higher standards
than that bed.

247
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,570
I'm going to get
some more lemonade.

248
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,285
I think your sister's mad
at our sister.

249
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,629
- We're back!
- Oh, well, there you are.

250
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,127
I guess "lunch, then home" means
different things to different people.

251
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,629
We had a girls' day.

252
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,962
Lily, Lily, come. Show
your papa what we bought.

253
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,797
Matching jackets!

254
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,303
It's like she's the baby
leopard and I'm the mama.

255
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,262
Or they just happened to have two
jackets, one large, one small.

256
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,896
What happened here?
Where is my tea?

257
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,645
Oh, it's in this drawer
over here.

258
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,350
As a thank-you,
I took some time ...

259
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,152
to rearrange your kitchen
so it makes sense.

260
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,571
To who?

261
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,523
To everyone. There's a flow now.
Watch.

262
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,779
Tea, mug, kettle.

263
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,868
You're welcome.
I didn't thank you.

264
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,040
You don't have to.
I won't.

265
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:12,256
Cam, our shared bathroom is not the place
to work out whatever's going on here.

266
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,840
I'm a child of divorce.

267
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,426
Conflict resolution
is something of a specialty.

268
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,638
The key is, tell a personal story
that applies to their situation,

269
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,439
even if you have to
make one up.

270
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,767
That way, they really hear
what they need to hear.

271
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,020
I'm sorry. You're right.

272
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,107
No. I'm sorry I snapped.

273
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,864
I'm just going through some stuff
with this girl I like, Danielle.

274
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:36,367
She came over the other day,
and Stella was all over her,

275
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,665
and I got jealous,
which is crazy, right?

276
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,210
I mean, Stella was only playing
with her because she was new.

277
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:46,006
Manny, sounds like Danielle was trying
to get between you and your puppy,

278
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,332
and that ain't cool.

279
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:51,136
She seems immature,
and you can do better.

280
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,932
I'm sorry to be blunt, but I'm goin'
through somethin' myself right now.

281
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,508
So chin up. Okay.

282
00:11:56,591 --> 00:12:00,141
It may not work every time, but
you only need one fish to bite.

283
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,893
Who is this Danielle?

284
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,066
She's my study partner in my history
class, and we share a notebook.

285
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,735
But her notes are really
confusing, so I put them in order.

286
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,063
Instead of thanking me
for making our lives easier,

287
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,444
she got all mad because she
thought I was judging her.

288
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,444
This girl
is very bad news, Manny.

289
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,529
You stay away from her.

290
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,126
Hey.
Hi.

291
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,791
We're Phil and Claire.
Hey. I'm Tony.

292
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,543
Come on in. I'll go get my dad.
Okay.

293
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:28,874
Great. Thanks.

294
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,251
Wow. I don't like the way
that kid was looking at you.

295
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:34,588
We are not friends right now. I am only
here to help pump up the college fund.

296
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:38,016
Claire, if Tad even makes a move
towards you, his ass is grass.

297
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,310
Really?
I thought that was just my ego.

298
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:43,104
So far, yeah, but just know
I'm ready to grass his ass.

299
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,556
Hey, hey, hey, guys.
Oh, hey.

300
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,308
Hey, how are you?
Good, good.

301
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,934
Good to see you.
Yeah.

302
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,519
Hi. That's good.

303
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,650
Well, I love the place.
Did you remodel this?

304
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:55,279
Uh, actually, my ex-wife. She had a,
uh, passion for modern architecture ...

305
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:56,985
and at least one
modern architect.

306
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,408
I have
to sell this one next.

307
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,410
Really?
Wow. I love how open it is.

308
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,158
Do you mind if I poke around?
Yeah.

309
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,500
It's beautiful.
All right. Thanks.

310
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,373
Tad, if you don't need my help
anymore with the kids,

311
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,916
I'll be going.
Thank you so much, Ellen.

312
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,755
You're welcome. Mmm. Okay,
we'll see you later.

313
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,253
I saw this house
eight years ago.

314
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,627
There used to be a wall here, right?
That's right. That's right.

315
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,753
That was all covered.
Yeah. I'm a detail guy.

316
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,051
Hard to get much past me.

317
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,220
Hello, hello.
Hey, how are you?

318
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,643
Good, Tad.
How you doing?

319
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:22,719
Bye, Daddy.
Bye, sweetie.

320
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,270
Bye, Dad.
Have fun.

321
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:25,639
Okay. See you later.
All right, bye.

322
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:26,974
Come on, guys. Let's go. Bye.

323
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:30,185
These stairs used
to be teak, am I right?

324
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:32,612
This guy's good.
Yeah. He's good.

325
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,523
He's sharp.
I forgot my bag.

326
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,650
You do that every time.

327
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,407
Yeah.

328
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,370
I don't miss much.

329
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,458
Oh, I'm sorry.
Were you trying to read?

330
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,130
You're the one
who tries to read.

331
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,003
Oh, my gosh!
I am not that stupid!

332
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,050
Seriously, Haley, you think you
are the coolest person ever.

333
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,094
Stop just judging me
about everything that I do!

334
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,843
Enough! Enough!

335
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,219
I am so sick of you two
fighting all the time.

336
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:04,553
You're a bad big sister,
and you're a bad little sister.

337
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,889
And you're both
bad big sisters to me.

338
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,474
Be normaler.

339
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:17,611
Wow. I've never
seen him like that.

340
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,569
Well, we do kind of neglect him.

341
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:25,157
And if you think about it,
he is kind of our little sister.

342
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,958
Remember how we used
to dress him up?

343
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,661
I miss her.

344
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:32,418
I hear you, and I don't
like where this is going.

345
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,750
You get the lipstick. I'll get
the bra and tennis balls.

346
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,926
Betty Luke!

347
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,844
I will burn this house down!

348
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,326
Where is the cheese grater?

349
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,828
Where is the cutting board?

350
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:10,160
Where would you want it to be?

351
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,548
Yes, right here,
next to the cheese grater.

352
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,718
I know it's hard to tell
by looking at me,

353
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:21,421
but I am not
a natural homemaker.

354
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:24,223
So when Cam came
and organized my kitchen,

355
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,427
I felt insecure
and lashed out.

356
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,060
In a way, I'm no better than
Manny's crazy friend Danielle.

357
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,563
Can we just focus on the cooking?

358
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,864
Daddy, we forgot
to give you this.

359
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,694
It's like our jackets.

360
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,615
I love it.

361
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,961
I guess I've always been a little
sensitive about Lily not having a mother,

362
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,663
and Gloria's so good at it.

363
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,124
I got jealous.

364
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,301
Maybe I should tell Manny
this story.

365
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,004
It might help him with that
train wreck, Danielle.

366
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,215
You know what? Why don't you
turn that music back on?

367
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,096
It was kind of nice.

368
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:33,706
Hey, Dad? Don't need
to talk about it.

369
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,003
I was out of line comin' down there.
It won't happen again.

370
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,422
- Scotch is at the bar.
- No, I've been giving this a lot of thought.

371
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,502
- I guess we're gonna talk about it.
- I was rude to you.

372
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,507
I think I was just annoyed
by all the lawyerjokes.

373
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,054
I mean, let's be honest.

374
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,757
You don't exactly beam with pride
over what I do for a living.

375
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,934
Mockery is the sincerest form
of flattery.

376
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,307
I'm pretty sure that's
not the saying, but-

377
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,105
Um, you know, Manny told me a
story about his friend Danielle.

378
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,980
Whew. She sounds like a real
piece of work, by the way.

379
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:02,064
But, uh, it made me realize that I
take myself a little too seriously.

380
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,524
Listen,
it goes without saying ...

381
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:07,531
I've always been proud of you, and
I brag about you all the time.

382
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:11,080
So if I say, "What do lawyers
use as birth control?",

383
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,157
and the answer is,
"Their personalities,"

384
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,993
I want you to know
I'm not referring to you.

385
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,916
You don't need
any birth control.

386
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,217
Hello.

387
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,340
Yeah, this is Jay Pritchett.

388
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,592
- What? When?
- What happened?

389
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,049
It's the police.
My car got stolen.

390
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,475
Yeah, 2012. Gray.

391
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,646
No, not pewter.
More like a light- like a-

392
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,939
No, not slate. Um-

393
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,812
I don't even know
what Coastal Fog is.

394
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,484
Just put down gray.

395
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,192
Kilo? That's not my car.

396
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:45,774
Yeah, she's Colombian.
What does that have to do with-

397
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,403
No, I'm comin' down there.
Hang on.

398
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,986
Grab your keys.
I think I might need a lawyer.

399
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,032
Guess who
just got his Bell rung?

400
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:03,591
That's good.
It's good.

401
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,384
Here you go.
Have a seat.

402
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,178
I got a bottle of port
from 1899.

403
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,346
Whoa.
Wow.

404
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,346
Okay, I got it for 18.99,
but it's a good one.

405
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:18,731
Fun night, right?
Yes.

406
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,646
Great dinner.
Yes.

407
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,819
And Tad is great,

408
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,358
and I know I was giving
you a hard time- Hey.

409
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,732
Hey, hey, Claire. but I feel like
I should say that I'm sorry.

410
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,988
You don't need to explain.

411
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,944
Your apology
is apology enough-.

412
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:34,497
Oh, I forgot the best part
of the Costa Rica story.

413
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:37,917
So we get home, and they've
taken over the living room.

414
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,619
They've taken over the kitchen.

415
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:42,125
I mean, they're in the food.
They're on the bed.

416
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:45,754
And finally, after two years of
complaining to Diego about this,

417
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,460
he finally stops and says,

418
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:52,049
"Okay, now I see it. You
do have a monkey problem."

419
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:01,187
A monkey problem! Yeah, I
heard him the first time.

420
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:05,691
You can kiss my wife, you can take her
to bed, but you cannot make her laugh.

421
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,649
I want to go back.

422
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:11,279
You can kiss my wife,

423
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,158
but only I can take her to bed
and make her laugh.

424
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,785
I want to go back.

425
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:21,745
Only I can take my wife
to bed, comma,

426
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,579
and make her laugh.

427
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:27,504
I mean,
they were in everything.

428
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,086
The only thing they didn't
the bananas.

429
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,674
Monkeys love bananas!

430
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,723
You would think they would love the bananas!
Yeah, we should go.

431
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,221
They'd want the bananas. Yeah, we need to go.
We gotta get goin'.

432
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,643
Oh, no, no, no.
Yeah, we're late.

433
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,437
But we just opened the- We're
late for getting home.

434
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,774
We're having-
Let's go.

435
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,189
Okay.  Okay.

436
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,736
What is wrong with you?

437
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,855
You laughed like it was
"Who's on first?" What?

438
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,907
He's on second.
Don't try to cheer me up.

439
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,655
I know what's going on here.
You're jealous.

440
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,078
Of him?
Uh-huh.

441
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:59,373
He's not even funny. What's he
got, like a soft 10 minutes?

442
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,042
And he goes to the Costa Rican well
a little too much for my taste.

443
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:04,291
Oh, God.

444
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:07,040
Really? This is still about the monkeys?
No, no, no, no.

445
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:10,218
It's you. You are making
me so happy right now.

446
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:13,216
You stormed out of there, and
you're acting like an idiot.

447
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,219
You like this? Because I'm
really uncomfortable.

448
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,845
Honey, I love it.

449
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,393
Makes me feel special.

450
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,017
Sometimes I really don't
understand you.

451
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:23,894
I know it's stupid,

452
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:26,271
but it's nice to know that
sometimes you'll fight for me,

453
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,604
and all I have to do is laugh
at some other guy's story.

454
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:32,315
But no one makes me laugh
like you do.

455
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:35,659
As long as it's always genuine.
Mm-hmm.

456
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:38,864
You can fake anything you want
with me, but not your laugh.

457
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,661
I'd like to go back.
Yeah.

458
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,249
Stop it! Leave me alone!

459
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,422
- Oh, hold still!
- Stop moving!

460
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,840
I hate you! Get off me!

461
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,838
What is going on?

462
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,421
You guys are in a lot
of trouble.

463
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,097
Haley, I told you
to clean this mess up.

464
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,766
And, Alex,
your books are everywhere.

465
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,185
Betty Luke, sit down
while your dad gets the camera.

466
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,352
Got it.

467
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:04,772
Last time,
you made a funny face ...

468
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,474
and we didn't really get
a good shot,

469
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:08,059
so let's work on our smile.

470
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,520
Okay. Good to see you,
Betty Luke.

471
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:17,943
