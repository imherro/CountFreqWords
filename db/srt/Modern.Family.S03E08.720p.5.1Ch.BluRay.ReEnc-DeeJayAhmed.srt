1
00:00:03,255 --> 00:00:06,508
Oh, thank you so much for the donation.
I wish I could do more.

2
00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:09,511
It's just a bunch of old, out-of-date clothes.
Oh, I'm sure it's great.

3
00:00:10,971 --> 00:00:12,973
Three weeks ago,
our neighbors, the Rands,

4
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:16,143
lost their house and
everything they own in a fire.

5
00:00:16,226 --> 00:00:18,228
Fortunately,
nobody was hurt.

6
00:00:18,312 --> 00:00:20,856
And fortunately, they're friends
with Wonder Woman over here.

7
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:22,441
I'm hardly Wonder Woman.

8
00:00:22,524 --> 00:00:26,653
She mobilized the community to donate
clothes, furniture, appliances.

9
00:00:26,778 --> 00:00:29,740
All to help them start over in their
new rental- Which you found them.

10
00:00:29,823 --> 00:00:33,160
I'm no Wonder Woman.
Rand-Aid was her idea.

11
00:00:33,243 --> 00:00:35,787
Wasn't my idea
to call it Rand-Aid.

12
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:38,999
Okay, fine.
I'm Wonder Woman.

13
00:00:39,124 --> 00:00:42,044
Terrible tragedy.
They're our closest friends.

14
00:00:42,127 --> 00:00:44,630
We know them. Uh, Manny and
their son Reuben are tight.

15
00:00:44,713 --> 00:00:46,381
In fact, I put in one of their closets.

16
00:00:46,465 --> 00:00:49,218
Not that it matters, but it was
the only structure to survive the fire.

17
00:00:49,301 --> 00:00:51,345
Par favor,
don't even say that word.

18
00:00:51,428 --> 00:00:53,889
In my country, it is considered
very, very bad luck...

19
00:00:53,972 --> 00:00:55,724
when your house burns down.

20
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,062
Th-They lived
a block away from us.

21
00:01:00,145 --> 00:01:03,565
Smoke was everywhere. I was so
upset, I couldn't sleep for days.

22
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:05,901
Of course, Mitchell
won't let me take anything.

23
00:01:05,984 --> 00:01:08,111
Well, Cam, we both know why.

24
00:01:08,195 --> 00:01:12,199
Some people have been known to sleepwalk
or even sleep-drive on that medication.

25
00:01:13,158 --> 00:01:14,701
Cam's reaction is much worse.

26
00:01:18,872 --> 00:01:20,165
Oh! No!

27
00:01:23,919 --> 00:01:27,589
Oh, God! Oh, God.

28
00:01:27,673 --> 00:01:29,549
I sleep-clown.

29
00:01:32,344 --> 00:01:34,137
- Dad, you're gonna kill yourself.
- I got it.

30
00:01:34,221 --> 00:01:35,555
We're on a schedule here.

31
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:37,099
I still have to pick up the truck.

32
00:01:37,182 --> 00:01:38,934
If you want him to
stop lifting things,

33
00:01:39,017 --> 00:01:42,354
put all this in grocery bags
and turn the TV on to a football game.

34
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:44,856
Oh, take this phone
away from me.

35
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,108
Why?

36
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:48,360
Two of our best brokers left
to start their own agency,

37
00:01:48,443 --> 00:01:50,237
and the office gossip is flying.

38
00:01:50,362 --> 00:01:53,115
But I want today to be about the Rands,
and if I have this-

39
00:01:53,198 --> 00:01:56,451
Oh, my God. Those guys took two
secretaries and the tube dude with them.

40
00:01:56,535 --> 00:01:58,036
Who's the tube dude?

41
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,539
You know, the blowy guy that attracts
all the attention. This guy.

42
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,874
Ah, sí, I've seen him.

43
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:05,669
He goes down with the air,
and then he shakes up.

44
00:02:05,794 --> 00:02:08,130
He goes down in the air, and then
up- You almost got it. Yeah.

45
00:02:08,213 --> 00:02:10,799
- And then goes down.
- Hi, hi. Sorry.

46
00:02:10,882 --> 00:02:13,760
We would've been here sooner, but
this one had a wardrobe crisis.

47
00:02:13,844 --> 00:02:16,596
You know, it's a somber occasion,
and all my tops are too joyful.

48
00:02:16,722 --> 00:02:18,348
- You do not want our problems.
- No.

49
00:02:18,473 --> 00:02:20,058
Here, Jay, let me- No, I got it.

50
00:02:20,183 --> 00:02:21,810
Dad! Ah! My back'

51
00:02:22,644 --> 00:02:24,021
No, Jay,
that's not quite it.

52
00:02:24,104 --> 00:02:26,940
Remember, you got air blowin' through you.
So it's more like-

53
00:02:27,024 --> 00:02:29,067
And then out and then out.

54
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:31,862
# Hey, hey #

55
00:02:31,945 --> 00:02:33,947
# Hey, hey #

56
00:02:34,031 --> 00:02:35,991
# Hey, hey #

57
00:02:36,074 --> 00:02:37,701
# Hey, hey #

58
00:02:37,784 --> 00:02:38,952
# Hey ##

59
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,165
Leave me alone.
I'm fine.

60
00:02:43,248 --> 00:02:45,083
I've gotta pick up that truck.

61
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:48,628
- I'd be happy to get the truck.
- I don't think so. it's a pretty big truck.

62
00:02:48,712 --> 00:02:52,966
Oh. Is it- Is it bigger than the combine
I've been driving since I was 12 years old?

63
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,843
Or the windrow tractor
with MacDon header...

64
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:57,888
that I drove to and parallel parked
at my high school prom?

65
00:02:57,971 --> 00:02:59,264
Hmm?

66
00:02:59,348 --> 00:03:01,058
At least something
got plowed that night.

67
00:03:01,141 --> 00:03:02,351
Heard that.

68
00:03:02,434 --> 00:03:05,145
- Son of a bitch!
- Your low back is in spasm, Jay.

69
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:06,897
I can massage that
out for you.

70
00:03:07,022 --> 00:03:08,482
I'm fine. Dad, you don't
know what you're missing.

71
00:03:08,607 --> 00:03:11,735
Phil is a magician.
And a licensed masseur.

72
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:16,198
Before I heard the siren song of residential
real estate, I was bitten by the rub bug.

73
00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:18,408
No, he's-he's amazing.
I had this knot in my leg.

74
00:03:18,492 --> 00:03:20,160
Two minutes with Phil,
and it was gone.

75
00:03:20,243 --> 00:03:22,245
I'm sorry, but I think you might
have a higher tolerance...

76
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:24,331
for a man's hands
on your body than I do.

77
00:03:24,414 --> 00:03:25,624
Charming.

78
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:28,377
Ay, don't be an idiot.
Let Phil help you.

79
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,296
- Fine.
- Great! I'll just go get the room ready.

80
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,715
You'll be surprised
with what these hands can do.

81
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:36,426
Really? Can they drive a Bobcat
skid-steer with a bucket grapple...

82
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,011
through a school hallway
on a dare?

83
00:03:38,095 --> 00:03:40,722
Because these can, and have.

84
00:03:43,642 --> 00:03:44,684
Poor Reuben, huh?

85
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,728
Having to rebuild
his whole life at age 12.

86
00:03:46,812 --> 00:03:49,064
Yeah. That blows.

87
00:03:49,147 --> 00:03:51,817
I know we're both shaken up,
but let's watch the language.

88
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,611
Okay, put this in a safe place.
it's for Reuben.

89
00:03:54,694 --> 00:03:58,198
It's one of those, um, how do you say again?

90
00:03:58,281 --> 00:04:01,451
Is that the helicopter with the camera
in it that you control with your phone?

91
00:04:01,535 --> 00:04:03,453
The one I asked for?

92
00:04:03,537 --> 00:04:05,997
Okay, when your house burn down,
you get one of these.

93
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:08,375
No, don't burn your house down.

94
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:13,296
How lucky is Reuben?
So lucky.

95
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,299
You know what? I say we take this
thing out and see how she flies.

96
00:04:16,383 --> 00:04:18,135
I don't know.
My morn got it for Reuben.

97
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,763
Oh, so now he won't even share his toys?
He never does.

98
00:04:21,888 --> 00:04:24,015
Screw that guy!
Yeah!

99
00:04:25,058 --> 00:04:27,477
You're a terrible influence.
You need me.

100
00:04:29,646 --> 00:04:32,649
Claire, in case
you want to add something,

101
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:36,570
I put the box of dresses outside, and
this is the box of snicker-snackers.

102
00:04:36,653 --> 00:04:39,239
Mmm.
Thanks.

103
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:42,826
Mitchell, we did have something
to add to this box of, um,

104
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:44,911
snicker-snackers.

105
00:04:44,995 --> 00:04:47,747
- What?
- English is not her first language.

106
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:51,042
- She's just trying to help.
- Mitchell, come on. You can't do that.

107
00:04:51,126 --> 00:04:54,171
You can't just change the rules.
it's what we do.

108
00:04:54,254 --> 00:04:57,757
When Gloria says something silly,
we innocently laugh behind her back.

109
00:04:57,841 --> 00:04:59,301
Come on. She's had a
rough week, all right?

110
00:04:59,384 --> 00:05:01,803
She's really worried about tia
Maria Cecilia and that surgery.

111
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:03,847
Oh, and then she lost
her cell phone at Pilates.

112
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,308
- How do you know this?
- We have coffee.

113
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:09,144
Oh, "have." So when did
this become, like, a thing?

114
00:05:09,227 --> 00:05:12,230
What's the big deal? We're friends.
I like Gloria.

115
00:05:12,314 --> 00:05:15,942
Uh, it's no big deal. It's-
I have nothing against her.

116
00:05:16,026 --> 00:05:17,527
I just think- Oh!

117
00:05:20,822 --> 00:05:23,950
All right. So before you get all
judgey, I gave her that vase.

118
00:05:24,034 --> 00:05:26,244
After I gave it to you.

119
00:05:30,874 --> 00:05:32,375
You couldn't part
with that T-shirt?

120
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:33,960
I love this shirt.

121
00:05:34,044 --> 00:05:36,004
You know, you don't have
to look the way you look.

122
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:40,717
Amber Rand lost all her clothes in a fire, but
she gets to build herself a new wardrobe.

123
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,928
Let me burn your clothes.

124
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:45,305
Girls, get down here!
There's a lot of work to do!

125
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,183
She's in a mood. You
know what we have to do, right?

126
00:05:48,308 --> 00:05:50,560
There's no way you're my real sister!
I hate you!

127
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:52,646
I can't believe- You're the
most selfish, shallow-

128
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:55,982
That's it! I cannot take the fighting!
Just get out of the house.

129
00:05:56,066 --> 00:05:58,443
Works every time.

130
00:05:58,527 --> 00:06:02,113
You know, I don't even want to drive the truck
anymore, even though on the farm I was-

131
00:06:02,197 --> 00:06:03,698
I can't take
another farm story.

132
00:06:03,823 --> 00:06:05,825
Yay! You might want to
take someone with you.

133
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:07,702
The thing's been parked there
six months.

134
00:06:07,786 --> 00:06:10,205
You're gonna want to
hose it down, sweep for spiders.

135
00:06:10,288 --> 00:06:12,582
Good news, girls.
You're goin' with Uncle Cam.

136
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,960
Huh?

137
00:06:16,127 --> 00:06:17,587
The pain must've
been pretty bad...

138
00:06:17,671 --> 00:06:19,214
if I was asking Phil for help.

139
00:06:19,297 --> 00:06:22,133
His need for my approval
is exhausting.

140
00:06:22,217 --> 00:06:26,763
In 10 years, I've asked him for one
thing- to hook up my wireless printer.

141
00:06:26,846 --> 00:06:28,723
He still won't shut up about it.

142
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:31,977
How's that
printer workin' out for you?

143
00:06:33,853 --> 00:06:35,772
Still lovin' that printer, huh?

144
00:06:35,855 --> 00:06:38,066
If your printer breaks from
here, I can fix it on my phone.

145
00:06:38,191 --> 00:06:42,696
Can you? I can, but I don't need
to, because I fixed it forever.

146
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:46,449
Just once, I wish he wouldn't make
such a big deal about everything.

147
00:06:48,827 --> 00:06:54,457
Okay. Now just disrobe and place
the towel over your buttocks.

148
00:07:02,591 --> 00:07:05,302
Ridin' the open
road in a big rig like this...

149
00:07:05,385 --> 00:07:08,013
sure can work up
a man's powerful appetite.

150
00:07:08,096 --> 00:07:09,556
We've gone five blocks.

151
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:11,641
Do you want a
burger or not? I could eat.

152
00:07:11,725 --> 00:07:15,520
Hey, Alex, maybe Uncle Cam will
let you borrow his hat later.

153
00:07:15,645 --> 00:07:18,982
You know, since you dress like a dude.
I like the way I dress.

154
00:07:19,107 --> 00:07:23,612
Uncle Cam, as her future prom date, will
you please talk to her? You know fashion.

155
00:07:23,695 --> 00:07:25,989
First of all, you're each
beautiful in your own way.

156
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:28,617
But you're both playing for second,
because I'm too sexy for this truck.

157
00:07:28,742 --> 00:07:32,704
I have to say, you do drive it surprisingly well.
Yeah, who'd have thought?

158
00:07:33,913 --> 00:07:35,457
Surprising?

159
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,667
What, that-that a gay man
can drive a truck?

160
00:07:37,751 --> 00:07:41,296
You know, I expect that kind of
thinking from Jay's generation.

161
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:44,049
But from our future generation?
No.

162
00:07:44,132 --> 00:07:47,177
Wow. This place got crowded.

163
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,346
Oh. You're
really wedged in there.

164
00:07:49,429 --> 00:07:51,222
You want us to help
guide you out?

165
00:07:52,265 --> 00:07:55,435
That question?
It was like a hate crime.

166
00:08:01,483 --> 00:08:02,984
Sorry!

167
00:08:03,068 --> 00:08:05,236
- Hey, you're really close on this side.
- Yeah, I see it.

168
00:08:05,862 --> 00:08:07,906
- Careful!
- I'm being careful.

169
00:08:09,741 --> 00:08:12,410
Gasping? Really?

170
00:08:16,623 --> 00:08:18,750
Holding hands.
We're not in a nosedive.

171
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:23,046
Look, if it would make you
feel better, get out and guide me.

172
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:25,215
Okay, come on.
Let's go.

173
00:08:25,298 --> 00:08:27,300
Please don't yell at me,
but there's not enough room.

174
00:08:27,384 --> 00:08:29,135
Okay, climb over.

175
00:08:34,516 --> 00:08:36,017
You're fine.

176
00:08:41,106 --> 00:08:46,236
You know, the Native Americans believed
that burning sage kept bad energy away.

177
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:49,989
How'd that work out for 'em?
Get to the back.

178
00:08:50,073 --> 00:08:52,200
That's the spirit.

179
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:54,327
Thank you.

180
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:58,665
Now I just need to make sure
that the oil is a perfect 98.6.

181
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:03,086
And it is perfect.

182
00:09:04,963 --> 00:09:07,882
Now, I want you to take
a deep breath,

183
00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:13,596
and let me transport you
to a land I call Relaxistan.

184
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,015
Oh, what the hell?
Get off me!

185
00:09:16,099 --> 00:09:17,642
I knew this was a terrible-

186
00:09:19,352 --> 00:09:21,062
Oh, Mama Lucian,
that's good.

187
00:09:21,146 --> 00:09:23,064
Shh.

188
00:09:25,275 --> 00:09:26,901
Shh.

189
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:30,405
So you want to try it?

190
00:09:30,488 --> 00:09:32,198
Uh, I don't know.
I'm still feeling guilty.

191
00:09:32,282 --> 00:09:34,033
It's Reuben's helicopter.

192
00:09:34,117 --> 00:09:36,911
Reuben is the whole reason
we should be doing this.

193
00:09:36,995 --> 00:09:40,832
He's barely-living proof that
life can change in a second.

194
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:43,501
You gotta grab what you can
when you can.

195
00:09:43,585 --> 00:09:46,004
What is this hold
you have on me?

196
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:48,923
Wow.

197
00:09:49,007 --> 00:09:50,967
- Okay, now ease up.
- Okay, I'm easing up.

198
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:54,971
- Okay, it's not working.
- Get ahold of yourself, Manny! She's getting away!

199
00:09:55,054 --> 00:09:58,516
- I can't hold her!
- Give it to me! Mayday! Mayday!

200
00:10:01,436 --> 00:10:04,230
Oh, well. What do you mean, "Oh, well"?
My mom's gonna kill us.

201
00:10:04,314 --> 00:10:06,024
Us?
You were flying it.

202
00:10:06,107 --> 00:10:07,942
I was in the attic,
packing boxes.

203
00:10:08,026 --> 00:10:10,695
You're gonna help me find it, or
the next search will be for you.

204
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,324
I like this guy.
Where's he been?

205
00:10:15,283 --> 00:10:18,161
Just relax.

206
00:10:18,244 --> 00:10:19,746
Let me know
if I'm hurting you.

207
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:22,040
Are you kidding me?
it's fantastic.

208
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,376
I love you.

209
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,046
This.
I love this.

210
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:31,633
It just slipped out. Those are the
worst three words I could say to Phil.

211
00:10:31,716 --> 00:10:34,844
I was just praying he would let it
go and not make a big deal about it.

212
00:10:34,928 --> 00:10:38,890
Oh, my God.
This is huge.

213
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:41,976
Jay, I'm sorry.
I need a minute.

214
00:10:43,102 --> 00:10:45,563
Son of a bitch!

215
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:50,068
Son of a bitch.

216
00:10:50,151 --> 00:10:53,071
Oh, these are fantastic. Why
is Manny getting rid of 'em?

217
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:54,781
He said that
they were last season.

218
00:10:54,864 --> 00:10:57,158
I used to have a pair like these.
I can never find 'em anymore.

219
00:10:57,242 --> 00:10:59,160
Oh, there's an outlet store.

220
00:10:59,244 --> 00:11:03,581
They don't have men's size, but I'm sure the
biggest size for boys will fit you perfectly.

221
00:11:03,665 --> 00:11:05,667
- I'll take you.
- All right, it's a date.

222
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,836
Oh. Another date.

223
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,963
Claire, I heard what
happened with the vase,

224
00:11:10,046 --> 00:11:12,590
but I don't want you
to worry about it.

225
00:11:12,674 --> 00:11:15,301
I'm so sorry. I should've
told you about that sooner.

226
00:11:15,385 --> 00:11:19,389
I just- I have really been
shaken by this whole fire thing.

227
00:11:19,472 --> 00:11:21,933
You know,
life is... so fragile.

228
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:24,477
I know.
Like a vase.

229
00:11:28,314 --> 00:11:29,858
You tattled on me?

230
00:11:29,941 --> 00:11:32,485
She asked me about it.
What was I supposed to do?

231
00:11:36,573 --> 00:11:38,658
Why are you making those cruel
sounds with your mouth?

232
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:42,620
You don't see it? You're
turning Gloria into Mom.

233
00:11:42,704 --> 00:11:43,663
What?
Mm-hmm.

234
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:45,415
First, you got
all defensive of her,

235
00:11:45,498 --> 00:11:47,166
and then
you tattled on me to her.

236
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,878
That's exactly what you did with old Mom.
It's what you're doing with new Mom.

237
00:11:49,961 --> 00:11:53,464
Okay, okay. Only you could make my
friendship with Gloria into something ugly.

238
00:11:53,548 --> 00:11:55,049
Don't get me wrong.
I think it's sweet.

239
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:58,052
We've all got our thing.
You have mommy issues.

240
00:11:58,136 --> 00:12:00,138
I do not have mommy issues.

241
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:02,599
Okay, so I pick you up
tomorrow.

242
00:12:02,682 --> 00:12:04,267
We go get you
your big boy pants,

243
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,603
and then we go and get
a little ice cream, okay?

244
00:12:07,854 --> 00:12:09,480
Perfect.

245
00:12:10,231 --> 00:12:12,191
I don't want to hear it.

246
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:16,029
Ay. You still
don't feel very good?

247
00:12:16,112 --> 00:12:17,530
I told Phil I loved him.

248
00:12:17,655 --> 00:12:20,241
Oh- it was an accident, but you
know how he gets with that stuff.

249
00:12:20,325 --> 00:12:21,492
Ay, I know.

250
00:12:21,576 --> 00:12:24,412
Jay, can I talk to you later
about what just happened?

251
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:25,705
Yeah.
Thanks.

252
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:27,290
Geez,
I just worked that out.

253
00:12:29,918 --> 00:12:31,961
You're screwed.

254
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:34,923
Today is the biggest day
of my life.

255
00:12:35,006 --> 00:12:38,051
Just relax.

256
00:12:38,134 --> 00:12:39,886
Let me know
if I'm hurting you.

257
00:12:40,011 --> 00:12:42,138
Are you kidding me?
it's fantastic.

258
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:44,057
I love you.

259
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,601
This.
I love this.

260
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:50,438
Oh, my God.
This is huge.

261
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:53,608
Jay, I'm sorry.
I need a minute.

262
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:55,193
The two guys
who left the firm...

263
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:57,612
asked me to quit my job and partner
with them at the new agency.

264
00:12:57,695 --> 00:13:01,240
Big opportunity,
big risk.

265
00:13:01,324 --> 00:13:04,118
And they need an answer
by the end of the day.

266
00:13:04,202 --> 00:13:06,704
I don't always make great
decisions under pressure.

267
00:13:07,413 --> 00:13:08,957
What the hell is that?

268
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,250
An alpaca.
I got the last one!

269
00:13:15,296 --> 00:13:17,048
Come on, man! Move that truck!

270
00:13:17,131 --> 00:13:18,883
I hate you!

271
00:13:18,967 --> 00:13:22,804
Okay, so I flirted with a table of
truckers who have offered to help us.

272
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:25,390
No! No help!
I've come too far.

273
00:13:25,473 --> 00:13:27,141
Have you?

274
00:13:27,225 --> 00:13:30,061
Hey, they don't sell pizzas at this restaurant!
You parked here illegally.

275
00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:32,939
Congratulations, sir.
You're destroying America.

276
00:13:33,064 --> 00:13:35,400
Hey, there are no cars behind us.
Go. Gun it!

277
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,197
- on! on!
- All right! Okay!

278
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,616
All right, everybody, relax!
We're fine! We're fine!

279
00:13:43,741 --> 00:13:45,576
We are not fine!
And we're all smushed!

280
00:13:45,702 --> 00:13:48,037
And we're scared! And we're
tilted at a 30 degree angle!

281
00:13:48,121 --> 00:13:50,540
Nerd! And we're dirty
and tired and late!

282
00:13:50,665 --> 00:13:52,417
Okay, can
you please just be quiet?

283
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,168
Why couldn't we have just
asked for help?

284
00:13:54,252 --> 00:13:55,837
'Cause I'm teaching you girls
a very valuable lesson-

285
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,256
that gay men can do anything
straight men can do.

286
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:01,676
Yeah, we know that. Do you think
you're the only gay guy that we know?

287
00:14:01,801 --> 00:14:04,095
Yeah. My soccer coach is gay.
Our pediatrician.

288
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,556
My Latin tutor. Nerd!
Our electrician.

289
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,058
Then why were you so surprised
when I said I could drive a truck?

290
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:12,228
Not because you're gay, because you're you.
And by the way, you can't.

291
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:14,188
Okay, wow. I guess I
owe you an apology.

292
00:14:14,272 --> 00:14:16,899
I made a leap there. I'm just
used to dealing with stereotypes.

293
00:14:16,983 --> 00:14:18,484
I'm a little sensitive
about it.

294
00:14:18,568 --> 00:14:20,611
Oh. Hey, there's that trucker
that I talked to. Hey!

295
00:14:20,695 --> 00:14:23,573
Excuse me. Hi! Could you
give us a hand, please?

296
00:14:23,656 --> 00:14:24,866
Sure thing, sweetie.

297
00:14:24,991 --> 00:14:27,493
Oh, like she'll
be able to help us.

298
00:14:31,581 --> 00:14:34,208
Oh, boy, do you have
the right idea.

299
00:14:34,292 --> 00:14:37,712
I could use a little break from the mother
and child reunion going on down there.

300
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:39,422
Don't ask.

301
00:14:43,051 --> 00:14:45,595
Mitchell's turning Gloria into Mom.
Barn! it's out. Hmm.

302
00:14:46,888 --> 00:14:49,098
You remember the way Mom
and Mitchell used to be...

303
00:14:49,182 --> 00:14:51,434
in their private little club?

304
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:54,312
Just the two of them,
no one else allowed in.

305
00:14:54,395 --> 00:14:57,815
Well-
it's happening again.

306
00:14:58,816 --> 00:15:00,443
But this time around,

307
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:03,362
it's happening with your wife.

308
00:15:03,446 --> 00:15:04,614
You should see them down there.

309
00:15:06,157 --> 00:15:09,577
It'd actually be adorable
if it weren't so sick.

310
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,370
I just-

311
00:15:11,454 --> 00:15:15,583
You know, I feel like Mitchell
is a grown man, he has a child,

312
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:20,213
and he's still working out some
psychodrama from 20 years ago.

313
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:23,883
Daddy, can I have a sip of your beer?
Thanks.

314
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:30,848
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

315
00:15:32,308 --> 00:15:35,436
Mitchell cozies up to Morn.
I go running to Daddy.

316
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,939
I'm the one
who's turning Gloria into Morn,

317
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:40,274
which is really disturbing,
since we're the same age.

318
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,694
You're older.
Oh.

319
00:15:43,778 --> 00:15:45,863
Oh, that's where
we're gonna chime in.

320
00:15:46,948 --> 00:15:49,617
Will you hurry up?
I'm saving my strength,

321
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,286
'cause if we don't find this
helicopter, I'm walking to Canada.

322
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:54,872
Hope you like taxes.

323
00:15:54,956 --> 00:15:56,958
Hey, that's our helicopter!

324
00:15:57,041 --> 00:16:00,253
Is it, now? I'm sure you have the
proper documentation for that.

325
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:02,213
Just give it back.
it's ours.

326
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:05,424
You guys are bullies. They can't be bullies.
They're nerds.

327
00:16:05,508 --> 00:16:06,926
Don't pigeonhole us.
We can be both.

328
00:16:08,511 --> 00:16:09,470
Oh.

329
00:16:09,554 --> 00:16:12,682
ls there an issue here?

330
00:16:12,765 --> 00:16:15,059
Uncle Cam,
I got this.

331
00:16:19,564 --> 00:16:21,607
Oh, my God, it's Alex Dunphy.
So awesome.

332
00:16:21,691 --> 00:16:23,568
What's the problem here, boys?

333
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:26,863
These geeks won't give us back our
helicopter that we took from Reuben.

334
00:16:26,946 --> 00:16:28,447
Is that right,
Abraham?

335
00:16:28,531 --> 00:16:29,991
Oh, my God,
she knows your name.

336
00:16:30,074 --> 00:16:31,242
Helicopter, please.

337
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:38,749
I love you.

338
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:40,918
What just happened?

339
00:16:41,002 --> 00:16:43,838
You have your fans,
I have mine.

340
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:47,508
Someday, your fans are
going to work for my fans.

341
00:16:51,554 --> 00:16:54,473
Oh. Um, Gloria, do you mind if I
talk to Mitchell alone for a minute?

342
00:16:54,557 --> 00:16:58,269
It's okay. I already know what you
said, and I think it's crazy.

343
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:00,271
Mitchell is not making me
his mommy.

344
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:03,774
No, I know, he's not.
But I think that I might be.

345
00:17:03,858 --> 00:17:08,112
Okay, now you're going really, really
crazy, because I am younger than you.

346
00:17:08,196 --> 00:17:10,948
Mmm, by 14 months,
so let's settle down.

347
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:13,492
What is going
on with you today?

348
00:17:13,576 --> 00:17:16,078
I- All right,
I'm working this out as I go.

349
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:22,084
I think maybe seeing you get all
buddy-buddy today with Gloria...

350
00:17:22,168 --> 00:17:25,838
made me feel like it did
when you were with Morn.

351
00:17:25,922 --> 00:17:29,967
And-And- I don't know,
I-l felt like the odd man out.

352
00:17:30,051 --> 00:17:32,595
Okay. Well, that's how I used
to feel with you and Dad.

353
00:17:33,346 --> 00:17:34,639
I know.

354
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:38,809
I know. We-We chose teams,
even during the divorce, and-

355
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:46,692
Okay, the last couple of years, you and
I have been our own team, you know?

356
00:17:46,776 --> 00:17:49,195
And I don't want that
to go away.

357
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,991
So, I guess I just felt a
little left out today. Shutup.

358
00:17:56,077 --> 00:17:58,537
Okay, can you two
try hugging a box...

359
00:17:58,621 --> 00:18:01,749
so that your poor mother doesn't
have to do all the hard work?

360
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:04,377
I am sorry, Gloria,
about all the mom stuff today.

361
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:08,422
I just- I got this crazy idea that
you like Mitchell better than me.

362
00:18:08,506 --> 00:18:10,508
I do like Mitchell
better than you.

363
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:11,592
Why?

364
00:18:11,676 --> 00:18:13,010
Ay, please.

365
00:18:13,094 --> 00:18:14,679
Are you going to
honestly tell me...

366
00:18:14,762 --> 00:18:17,014
that I'm your favorite
person in this family?

367
00:18:17,098 --> 00:18:19,976
I'm not even your favorite
Colombian in this family.

368
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:23,229
I would love to get closer to you.
You have my number.

369
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:26,941
But call me quickly,
because I book up.

370
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:30,111
You never saw me!

371
00:18:33,948 --> 00:18:36,325
There you are. I really
need to talk to you.

372
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,744
You really don't. Jay, please.
it's about work.

373
00:18:38,828 --> 00:18:40,454
I got a text
during your massage.

374
00:18:40,538 --> 00:18:42,498
I've been offered a
partnership in a new agency.

375
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:44,417
Oh.

376
00:18:46,002 --> 00:18:48,462
Good for you.
Well, I'm not so sure.

377
00:18:48,546 --> 00:18:52,508
I mean, there's-there's a big upside,
but I have a stable job right now.

378
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:55,136
I have three kids, and at least
one of 'em's going to college.

379
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:57,430
Worst-case scenario,
they all go.

380
00:18:57,513 --> 00:18:59,098
Well, what does Claire think?

381
00:19:00,433 --> 00:19:03,227
I haven't told her yet. I
wanted to talk to you first.

382
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:04,812
You've done this.

383
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:08,357
Well, I think that there's
only really one question.

384
00:19:08,441 --> 00:19:10,109
Whether I'm ready
to run my own company?

385
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:13,321
Nah, you're great with people.
We know you're a good salesman.

386
00:19:13,404 --> 00:19:16,282
You've managed to provide
a good living in tough times.

387
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:17,825
Then what?
Is this the right time?

388
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:20,036
Never a perfect time.
House could burn down tomorrow.

389
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:23,622
Question is, do you want this?

390
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:27,543
Yeah.
Yeah, I really want it.

391
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:29,879
Then gamble on yourself.

392
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:33,215
I'd gamble on you.

393
00:19:35,301 --> 00:19:36,260
I'm gonna do it.

394
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:38,054
There you go.

395
00:19:38,137 --> 00:19:39,889
Thanks, Jay.

396
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:42,183
Hey, look, I know you were
reluctant to get that massage,

397
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:44,769
but I think we can both agree
it had a happy ending.

398
00:19:46,604 --> 00:19:48,064
Please don't say that.

399
00:19:48,147 --> 00:19:51,484
If I could only save
one possession in a fire-

400
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:54,904
Probably my first set of golf clubs.
My old man gave 'em to me.

401
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:56,906
Here, I got it.
No,no,no.

402
00:19:58,616 --> 00:20:01,619
The engagement ring that
Jay gave me that changed my life.

403
00:20:02,745 --> 00:20:04,330
Lily's adoption papers.

404
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:06,332
I Was gonna
say adoption papers.

405
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:09,877
So I guess then I would say
my mama's recipe book.

406
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:13,547
All our family photos...

407
00:20:13,631 --> 00:20:16,092
which I keep on my iPad,
so my iPad.

408
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:19,970
As long as I had my family,
I wouldn't need anything else.

409
00:20:20,054 --> 00:20:22,390
What?

410
00:20:22,473 --> 00:20:25,267
You say somethin' like that,
it makes us all seem petty.

411
00:20:25,351 --> 00:20:27,895
Yeah. I know. I know.

412
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:30,606
Boo!

413
00:20:31,816 --> 00:20:32,817
Hiss!

414
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,324
Shh. Cam's sleeping.
I don't want to wake him.

415
00:20:40,408 --> 00:20:41,450
He's had a rough day.

416
00:20:41,534 --> 00:20:43,035
Not as rough
as Grandpa's truck.

417
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,663
Shh.

418
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:46,914
Thank you so much for driving
me.

419
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:48,707
I really didn't want to ride
in that big rig.

420
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,209
It was amazing.

421
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:53,003
Everybody was honking, and I
learned, like, five new curse words.

422
00:20:53,129 --> 00:20:54,505
Mostly from Cam.
Shh!

423
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:57,675
I'm glad
I could give you a laugh today.

424
00:20:57,758 --> 00:21:00,052
I didn't know that's what I was
to you people, a big joke.

425
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:02,346
No, honey, it wasn't like that.
No, we didn't mean-

426
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:04,682
- Uncle Cam, we love you.
- Save it.

427
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:06,183
I'm going back to bed.

428
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,103
So he's still doing that?

429
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:11,188
Yeah, yeah. But we're
workin' on it.

430
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:19,947
English - US - PSDH
