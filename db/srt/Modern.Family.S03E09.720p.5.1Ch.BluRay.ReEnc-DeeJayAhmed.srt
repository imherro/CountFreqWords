1
00:00:03,672 --> 00:00:07,301
"Oh, my goodness, those
hands are cold." Mm-hmm.

2
00:00:07,426 --> 00:00:10,429
"At least buy me dinner
first."  Boom.

3
00:00:11,388 --> 00:00:14,141
"Tell my wife and kids
I love them."

4
00:00:14,266 --> 00:00:17,477
Oh, my God. Ooh. That's
kind of dark, Morn.

5
00:00:17,561 --> 00:00:19,104
What?

6
00:00:19,229 --> 00:00:21,190
Quick. What's my favorite
hospital food? Um-

7
00:00:21,315 --> 00:00:23,358
Jell-O!

8
00:00:23,442 --> 00:00:25,527
Hey, buddy.
No, today's still good.

9
00:00:25,611 --> 00:00:26,862
Good for what?
Who's "buddy"?

10
00:00:26,945 --> 00:00:28,614
Yeah, just head
on over to the house.

11
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:31,325
Whose house? Who's "buddy"? Okay.
See you in a couple.

12
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:32,784
Couple of what?
Who's "buddy"?

13
00:00:32,868 --> 00:00:34,369
- Kenneth.
- Kenneth?

14
00:00:34,453 --> 00:00:35,996
Kenneth!

15
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:39,082
If I had a son, I'd want him to be like
Kenneth Ploufe. You do have a son.

16
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,668
When we first moved in here, he was
the sweet kid who lived next door.

17
00:00:41,752 --> 00:00:43,212
Mmm, the weird kid
who lived next door.

18
00:00:43,295 --> 00:00:44,838
But Phil always had
a soft spot for him...

19
00:00:44,922 --> 00:00:46,423
because Kenneth sort of
looked up to him.

20
00:00:46,548 --> 00:00:48,967
I wouldn't say hero.
And yet, you did.

21
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:51,053
Well, you weren't going to.

22
00:00:51,136 --> 00:00:53,222
Claire's always had
some issues with Kenneth.

23
00:00:53,305 --> 00:00:55,807
He would stare at me
a little too long.

24
00:00:55,933 --> 00:00:57,893
Can you blame him?

25
00:00:57,976 --> 00:00:59,978
You used to dress
sexy back then.

26
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:04,107
- Hey!
- Yeah!

27
00:01:04,191 --> 00:01:06,109
Ohh!

28
00:01:06,235 --> 00:01:07,736
Ahh!
Oh, wow.

29
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:09,738
Oh, 10 years.
Can you believe it?

30
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:10,906
Mm-mmm.  God.

31
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:13,283
Ohh! I feel like we ended
that last hug too soon.

32
00:01:13,408 --> 00:01:15,744
Come back here.

33
00:01:15,827 --> 00:01:17,913
Oh, wow!
That's a lot of hugging.

34
00:01:17,996 --> 00:01:19,998
She's right.
Why hug, when you can-

35
00:01:20,082 --> 00:01:22,084
- Man shake.
- Oh, no.

36
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,715
I'm gonna get the coffee.

37
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,969
Man shake.
Are we sure?

38
00:01:32,052 --> 00:01:34,471
Mmm! Mmm.

39
00:01:34,554 --> 00:01:37,182
Roll up the curtain!

40
00:01:37,266 --> 00:01:38,267
Bing!

41
00:01:39,142 --> 00:01:40,852
# Hey, hey #

42
00:01:40,936 --> 00:01:43,021
# Hey, hey #

43
00:01:43,105 --> 00:01:45,190
# Hey, hey #

44
00:01:45,274 --> 00:01:47,276
# Hey, hey #

45
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:48,360
# Hey ##

46
00:01:50,821 --> 00:01:52,281
I don't know what's worse,

47
00:01:52,364 --> 00:01:54,950
that he competes every Thanksgiving
in a pie-eating contest...

48
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:56,994
or that he's nine-time runner-up.

49
00:01:57,077 --> 00:01:58,578
It wouldn't be Thanksgiving
without the contest.

50
00:01:58,662 --> 00:02:00,122
Yes, it would.

51
00:02:00,205 --> 00:02:02,916
I think I have to tell
my punkin chunkin' story.

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,459
Oh, no. No, you don't have to.

53
00:02:04,543 --> 00:02:06,670
No, I kind of think I have to.

54
00:02:06,753 --> 00:02:08,255
Once, Cam and his friends...

55
00:02:08,338 --> 00:02:09,631
tried to slingshot a pumpkin...

56
00:02:09,715 --> 00:02:11,508
across a football field.

57
00:02:11,591 --> 00:02:13,677
Three seconds.
That's all he needs to tell that story.

58
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,514
So the fog was rolling in over the
mountains like an ominous blanket...

59
00:02:17,597 --> 00:02:20,142
as we readied
the giant slingshot.

60
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:22,394
You know, Lorna, the pastor's daughter,
she was nervous,

61
00:02:22,477 --> 00:02:24,771
because like I said,
it was after curfew.

62
00:02:24,855 --> 00:02:28,358
She was a goodie-two-shoe.
Only pastor's daughter I ever met that was.

63
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:37,117
So we finally launch the pumpkin, and it
sails through the air, goalpost to goalpost,

64
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,120
past the end zone,
into the parking lot,

65
00:02:40,203 --> 00:02:42,581
through the open roof
of Lorna's dad's car.

66
00:02:42,664 --> 00:02:47,461
I turn to Cody and I say, "Now what are
the chances of that landing there?"

67
00:02:47,544 --> 00:02:50,756
He says, "Where?",
and I say,

68
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:53,592
"The sunroof
of a preacher man."

69
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,263
Wah-wah.

70
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,811
Okay, come on in!

71
00:03:06,063 --> 00:03:08,357
- Voilà!
- Okay, what are we looking at?

72
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,150
My centerpiece for Thanksgiving.

73
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:12,402
It is wonderful.
You're so talented.

74
00:03:12,486 --> 00:03:14,363
I can't believe that you did this.

75
00:03:14,446 --> 00:03:16,823
Yeah, my juices were really
flowing on this one.

76
00:03:16,907 --> 00:03:18,784
I actually shot a making-of video.

77
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:20,577
Hey, maybe we can watch it
later at the party.

78
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,496
Oh, yeah. That or football.

79
00:03:23,455 --> 00:03:25,665
Mi amor,
I'm so proud of you.

80
00:03:25,749 --> 00:03:30,003
- Is there nothing in the world that you can't do?
- Centerpieces, for starters.

81
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:33,006
Shh! Why do you say everything of
his is great, even if it isn't?

82
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,176
Because I'm building him up.
That's what parents do.

83
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:37,719
Too much, if you ask me.

84
00:03:37,803 --> 00:03:39,679
Kids cross the street nowadays,
they get a ribbon.

85
00:03:39,763 --> 00:03:41,390
Manny's got plenty of confidence.

86
00:03:41,473 --> 00:03:43,892
He just needs a little reality check
every now and then.

87
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:46,061
And this thing is a horn of ugly.

88
00:03:46,144 --> 00:03:49,689
Shh! My mother used to
criticize everything I did.

89
00:03:49,773 --> 00:03:53,360
And look at me now.
I am a jumble of insecurities.

90
00:03:53,443 --> 00:03:54,653
I'm not getting that.

91
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:56,822
Do not say a word to Manny.

92
00:03:56,905 --> 00:04:01,410
Fine. But trust me, if you told him
the truth, he'd thank you later.

93
00:04:01,493 --> 00:04:04,287
Mmm, like Claire and Mitch?
Did they thank you?

94
00:04:04,371 --> 00:04:06,164
Not yet.
Mmm.

95
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:08,667
But it's coming.
Hmm.

96
00:04:10,127 --> 00:04:13,422
Oh! So many memories
in this place.

97
00:04:13,505 --> 00:04:15,048
Do you guys still have,
like, every cereal?

98
00:04:15,173 --> 00:04:17,384
We have a lot.
Yeah, of course you do.

99
00:04:17,467 --> 00:04:20,053
Of course you do. You only have
the greatest dad in the world.

100
00:04:20,137 --> 00:04:23,223
So what have you been up to? I haven't
seen you since you went off to college.

101
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:24,975
Oh, you know, actually,
that didn't work out so well.

102
00:04:25,058 --> 00:04:28,145
I bounced around for a while. Ended
up washing dishes in New Mexico.

103
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,521
Mmm.  Mmm.

104
00:04:29,604 --> 00:04:31,273
So without the benefit
of a college degree,

105
00:04:31,356 --> 00:04:33,442
I guess your options
were kind of limited, huh?

106
00:04:33,525 --> 00:04:35,110
Ease up. it's a holiday.

107
00:04:35,193 --> 00:04:37,362
Yeah, it was- it was-
Oh, no. No, thank you.

108
00:04:37,487 --> 00:04:39,281
Thank you, though, sweetie.
You're so sweet. Oh, okay.

109
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:42,576
It was tough for a while, but then a
roommate and I started our own business.

110
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:45,370
Oh, was that also in the dish
or cleaning industry?

111
00:04:45,454 --> 00:04:48,290
No. No, no, no. It was actually
a small investment company.

112
00:04:48,373 --> 00:04:51,626
Well, small at first. You know, we
rode the tech wave for a while,

113
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:55,755
then expanded into video games,
amusement parks, sports arenas.

114
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:57,507
Anything that seemed
awesome, really.

115
00:04:57,591 --> 00:04:59,134
I'm actually in town
to buy a blimp.

116
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:01,094
Holy crow.

117
00:05:01,178 --> 00:05:03,805
Wow. So if y-
if you'd gone to college,

118
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:07,392
you would've done all that,
just four years later- or never.

119
00:05:07,476 --> 00:05:10,937
Alex really needs to be picked up, sweetie.
Why don't you go get her?

120
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:13,690
I want to hear more of what he
has to say about- We're leaving.

121
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:17,903
Kenneth, I am so proud of you.
You really made it.

122
00:05:17,986 --> 00:05:19,863
Well, I did get
one pretty lucky break.

123
00:05:21,114 --> 00:05:23,909
Early on, I met
a very special guy...

124
00:05:23,992 --> 00:05:27,579
who taught me that what I
thought and said had value.

125
00:05:27,704 --> 00:05:30,749
Oh, you mean- Shh. Luke,
let the man talk.

126
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:34,544
He encouraged me to always find
the fun and follow this thing.

127
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:36,296
Your lung?
No, my heart.

128
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:40,800
To this day, at every crossroad,
I ask myself one question:

129
00:05:40,884 --> 00:05:42,344
What would Phil Dunphy do?

130
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:45,388
Record scratch!

131
00:05:45,472 --> 00:05:48,475
Oh, that's me buzzing.
Oh, it's Paris.

132
00:05:48,558 --> 00:05:50,143
She's my assistant in Tokyo.

133
00:05:50,227 --> 00:05:54,564
You'd think they'd know how to demo
4-D gaming graphics without my help.

134
00:05:54,648 --> 00:05:57,943
They don't. Hey, Luke, what
instrument does Yo-Yo Ma play?

135
00:05:58,068 --> 00:05:59,069
Um-
Cello!

136
00:06:00,362 --> 00:06:02,155
He's me.

137
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,241
And he's spectacular.

138
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,910
Oh, my God.

139
00:06:06,993 --> 00:06:09,871
Kenneth Ploufe is part owner
of a resort in the Bahamas,

140
00:06:09,955 --> 00:06:11,873
some cruise line...

141
00:06:11,957 --> 00:06:14,626
and Lacy Fair,
that lingerie company.

142
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:17,045
Oh, ew! I'm wearing
one of his bras.

143
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:18,838
Look, he's got a model in his lap.

144
00:06:18,964 --> 00:06:20,006
No way.
Look at her.

145
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:27,472
This is your fault!

146
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,189
Are you seriously
gonna stay in here all day?

147
00:06:36,273 --> 00:06:39,442
I can't face Mom.
If I see her, I'm gonna have to confess.

148
00:06:39,526 --> 00:06:42,195
Take a breather.
it's just a dent.

149
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:44,906
And saying nothing
is not lying, okay?

150
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,617
It's just letting the truth
speak for itself.

151
00:06:47,701 --> 00:06:49,744
This is not the time
for moral equivocation.

152
00:06:49,828 --> 00:06:53,039
Okay, I don't know what that means,
and also, don't tell me.

153
00:06:53,123 --> 00:06:56,293
You're the one who's going to lose her driving privileges.
I don't know why you're so calm.

154
00:06:56,376 --> 00:06:59,879
All we have to do is keep it from
Mom until she goes to the store.

155
00:06:59,963 --> 00:07:04,217
Then, when she sees it, she'll assume
that it happened there, which it did.

156
00:07:04,301 --> 00:07:05,885
So it's not really lying.

157
00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:07,679
Listen to you.

158
00:07:07,762 --> 00:07:09,723
Are you gonna be
a career criminal?

159
00:07:09,806 --> 00:07:11,266
You sound like Morn.

160
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:13,685
I don't know what I'm gonna
do after high school.

161
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,647
It was a supportive wah-wah.
I was trying to save the moment.

162
00:07:17,731 --> 00:07:19,691
There's no such thing
as a supportive wah-wah.

163
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:21,776
A wah-wah, by its very nature,
is vicious and undercutting.

164
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,945
Well, I was just trying to
salvage that story, okay?

165
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:26,615
I told you not to tell it,
you told it, and it died.

166
00:07:26,698 --> 00:07:28,241
It did not die. it's a thinker.

167
00:07:28,325 --> 00:07:30,910
The only thing people were thinking was,
"Thank God this story's over."

168
00:07:30,994 --> 00:07:32,454
Okay, I get it.

169
00:07:32,537 --> 00:07:34,456
So how long have I been
embarrassing you with my stories?

170
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:36,041
No, no, no, no.
You don't embarrass me.

171
00:07:36,124 --> 00:07:37,876
I love your stories, okay?

172
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,753
The tractor in the swimming hole?

173
00:07:39,836 --> 00:07:41,379
Aunt Betty's wiglet on the piglet?

174
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:44,716
Uncle Carl said you couldn't
tell 'em apart. See?

175
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:46,760
Those are funny.
You have so many great ones.

176
00:07:46,843 --> 00:07:49,638
Well, that's farm life. Rain or shine,
there's always a bumper crop of stories.

177
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:53,058
Yeah, I'm just saying maybe you take
punkin chunkin' out of the rotation.

178
00:07:53,141 --> 00:07:54,434
I guess you're right.
Maybe I could-

179
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:57,479
Stick to the ones that really happened.
People love those.

180
00:07:57,562 --> 00:07:59,314
Excuse me, what?

181
00:07:59,397 --> 00:08:01,566
I'm-I'm just saying people
laugh more at stories that are true.

182
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,234
Punkin chunkin'
is a true story.

183
00:08:03,318 --> 00:08:04,653
Truish?

184
00:08:04,736 --> 00:08:06,529
No, true.

185
00:08:06,613 --> 00:08:09,658
Really?
The length of a football field,

186
00:08:09,741 --> 00:08:14,162
through the sunroof of a oar that
was open in late November in Missouri?

187
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:15,497
It was unseasonably warm.

188
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,791
That explains the fog
rolling over the hill.

189
00:08:17,874 --> 00:08:20,418
And who's Cody, who you're
close enough to chunk with,

190
00:08:20,502 --> 00:08:22,837
but mysteriously only
appears in this story?

191
00:08:22,921 --> 00:08:25,465
Cody was K.I.A. in Desert Storm.
He's a hero.

192
00:08:28,677 --> 00:08:32,639
You know, all this from someone
who's never even chunked a punkin.

193
00:08:33,682 --> 00:08:35,058
Well, I've never
lunked a tunkin either.

194
00:08:35,141 --> 00:08:36,935
These aren't real things.

195
00:08:37,977 --> 00:08:40,230
This'll work, right?
Totally, Dad.

196
00:08:40,313 --> 00:08:44,526
Why have one long table when you can
use four little ones, bistro style?

197
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:46,778
I bet this is how the French
do Thanksgiving.

198
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:49,823
You don't mind sittin' with your Uncle
Mitch and, uh, Grandpa, do you?

199
00:08:49,906 --> 00:08:52,200
Anything's better
than watching Lily chew.

200
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:56,287
By the way, this is the side of your old
man that Kenneth was talking about.

201
00:08:56,371 --> 00:08:57,914
Original.

202
00:08:57,997 --> 00:09:00,208
Imaginative.

203
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:04,462
Fearless.

204
00:09:04,546 --> 00:09:09,300
So Kenneth became a gajillionaire by
asking himself, "What would Phil do?"

205
00:09:09,384 --> 00:09:12,011
He sure did.

206
00:09:12,095 --> 00:09:14,681
Where did that
come from, right?

207
00:09:14,764 --> 00:09:18,059
But you're you.
Why aren't We gajillionaires?

208
00:09:18,184 --> 00:09:21,229
Why don't you do what
Phil would do? Um-

209
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:24,858
Phil, why didn't you just put
the extra leaves in the table?

210
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:27,527
Tryin' to have some fun.
Be creative.

211
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,362
One long table, honey.

212
00:09:29,446 --> 00:09:31,823
If it was good enough for the Last
Supper, it's good enough for us.

213
00:09:36,286 --> 00:09:38,496
I'm having second thoughts
about this centerpiece.

214
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:40,290
Ay, no.
Hear him out.

215
00:09:40,373 --> 00:09:43,209
I just think if we bring it to Phil and
Claire's, we'll never see it again, right?

216
00:09:43,293 --> 00:09:44,335
That's the plan.

217
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:46,463
Well, that'll be sad.

218
00:09:46,546 --> 00:09:50,258
Except maybe my sadness will inspire
me to create something even greater.

219
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:52,719
Remember that collage I made that
helped us get through Katrina?

220
00:09:52,844 --> 00:09:54,721
Mm-hmm. You did this,
you know that.

221
00:09:54,804 --> 00:09:58,391
So, is this the legendary rice pilaf
we've been hearing about?

222
00:09:58,475 --> 00:10:00,018
Try for yourself.

223
00:10:00,101 --> 00:10:03,271
I used to make it every year, but it,
uh, started to upstage the turkey.

224
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:04,647
Hmm.

225
00:10:04,773 --> 00:10:08,067
Something wrong? Not so
much wrong as... missing.

226
00:10:08,151 --> 00:10:10,069
It just tastes a little flat.

227
00:10:10,195 --> 00:10:13,114
That a fact? I just think with
the earthiness of the rice,

228
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:15,492
you might want something
zesty to set it off.

229
00:10:15,575 --> 00:10:17,243
I think this might be a job for cumin.

230
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:19,287
You know, since we're sharing
helpful criticisms- No,no,no.

231
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:22,207
Nobody's sharing anything.
Manny, go change for the party.

232
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,209
No, no, no, but I appreciate
helpful criticisms.

233
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:27,378
It's, uh- it's important for me
that I hear the truth.

234
00:10:27,462 --> 00:10:30,507
Makes me stronger,
less of a mama's boy.

235
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,258
Yeah, Mom, he can take it.

236
00:10:32,342 --> 00:10:36,888
That's what he says, but you don't
really know what he feels underneath.

237
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:40,558
Some people are so sensitive
that they hear one criticism...

238
00:10:40,642 --> 00:10:44,729
and it kills the spark
that made them special.

239
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:47,106
I think I know what's going on here.
Good.

240
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,859
- This is about you and your morn, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

241
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:52,237
No, it isn't.
Yes, it is!

242
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,073
Manny, don't upset me anymore.
Go. Go change.

243
00:10:56,115 --> 00:10:57,408
What should I wear?

244
00:10:57,492 --> 00:10:59,452
Ay, you look good
in everything.

245
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,417
Where you goin', Mom?

246
00:11:06,501 --> 00:11:10,338
I gotta run to the store.
Someone ate all the marshmallows.

247
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:12,257
Hey, can I tell you something?

248
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,219
I was thinking that maybe after New Year's
break, we could visit a couple more colleges.

249
00:11:16,302 --> 00:11:17,679
Seriously?

250
00:11:17,762 --> 00:11:19,681
I was so hard on you before.
I'm sorry.

251
00:11:19,764 --> 00:11:22,851
I know I'm no Kenneth. I'm gonna
need all the help that I can get.

252
00:11:22,934 --> 00:11:26,688
Honey, I am so proud of you.
Oh.

253
00:11:26,771 --> 00:11:28,273
Oh, thank you.
Mm-hmm.

254
00:11:28,356 --> 00:11:31,025
What's this? Oh, okay.

255
00:11:31,109 --> 00:11:33,111
- What are you doing?
- Oh, Uncle Mitchell's picking up the marshmallows.

256
00:11:33,236 --> 00:11:36,030
Then again, backpacking through Europe
could be educational in its own way.

257
00:11:36,114 --> 00:11:37,657
No!No,no.
No,no,no.

258
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,450
Do you know what's
illegal in Europe?

259
00:11:39,534 --> 00:11:42,078
Nothing.
You're going to college.

260
00:11:42,161 --> 00:11:43,288
Okay, fine.

261
00:11:43,371 --> 00:11:45,331
Darn right, it's fine.

262
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:48,126
Piece of cake.

263
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:51,963
My hair's coming out!

264
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:55,967
Wow, honey. I think you
could make these simpler.

265
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,469
Just, you know, sort of do 'em
flat and on the side.

266
00:11:58,553 --> 00:12:00,763
Hmm. Yeah, seems like
that's how you like me.

267
00:12:00,847 --> 00:12:02,348
Flat and on the side.

268
00:12:02,432 --> 00:12:05,143
You know what? Sometimes I need
to be puffed up and frilly.

269
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:07,437
Is this one of those moments
I'm gonna have to remember later...

270
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,314
when they ask me
if there were any signs?

271
00:12:09,397 --> 00:12:11,065
This is what Phil would do.

272
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:14,736
Make fantastic napkin origami
that startles and delights his guests.

273
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:17,780
I know. But, sweetie, they're just
looking a little-

274
00:12:17,864 --> 00:12:20,867
Claire, you always do this.
You squelch me.

275
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,119
You squelch me right
when I'm about to soar.

276
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:24,746
Honey, you're folding napkins.

277
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:26,539
You're folding my dreams.

278
00:12:26,623 --> 00:12:28,750
You know what Kenneth told me?

279
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,835
The secret to his success?

280
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:33,046
His whole career,
he's tried to emulate me.

281
00:12:33,171 --> 00:12:37,342
The only difference is, he hasn't had someone
constantly telling him what not to do.

282
00:12:37,425 --> 00:12:41,179
So the only reason we don't have a
blimp tethered to our mailbox...

283
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:43,973
is because I'm always shooting
down your great ideas?

284
00:12:44,098 --> 00:12:45,183
Yeah.

285
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:47,268
Let's review
the squelch pile, Phil.

286
00:12:47,352 --> 00:12:49,687
Let's see.
The rice pudding franchise.

287
00:12:49,771 --> 00:12:50,980
Works for all chewing abilities.

288
00:12:51,064 --> 00:12:52,398
Adult tricycles.

289
00:12:52,482 --> 00:12:53,566
Just try to fall off.

290
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:54,734
The aspirin gun.

291
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:57,236
Some people have
a hard time swallowing.

292
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,533
And you left one out. And that, my dear,
Claire, is a Real Head-Scratcher, T.M.

293
00:13:04,702 --> 00:13:06,037
Action.

294
00:13:07,497 --> 00:13:09,791
Hey, friend.

295
00:13:09,874 --> 00:13:11,960
You look like you had
a rough day at the office.

296
00:13:12,043 --> 00:13:15,296
The stress from my job
at the robot assassin factory-

297
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,799
is too much to take.

298
00:13:17,882 --> 00:13:20,259
Aw, shoot me an aspirin, pal.

299
00:13:20,343 --> 00:13:24,973
Maybe some day.
But until then, try this on for size.

300
00:13:25,056 --> 00:13:28,351
The Real Head-Scratcher features
32 patent-pending nogginizers...

301
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:32,397
that gently massage your scalp
in a soothing purr of motorized delight.

302
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:36,275
Ah. And it feels great.

303
00:13:36,359 --> 00:13:38,569
And it looks good too.

304
00:13:38,653 --> 00:13:40,154
It's a real life-saver.

305
00:13:40,238 --> 00:13:41,948
You mean a Real Head-Scratcher?

306
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:49,664
I love you, Phil, but you-

307
00:13:49,747 --> 00:13:51,958
Stop. I love your
"I love you."

308
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,960
I'm gettin' awful tired of your "but."

309
00:13:54,961 --> 00:13:56,713
I heard it.

310
00:13:56,796 --> 00:13:57,839
Tsk.

311
00:14:12,395 --> 00:14:14,188
Welcome, welcome, welcome!

312
00:14:14,272 --> 00:14:15,690
Happy Turkey Day.

313
00:14:15,815 --> 00:14:17,150
Hey, is that a new car?
Yep.

314
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:19,777
- It's the best, isn't it?
- I can't take my eyes off it.

315
00:14:19,861 --> 00:14:21,279
You shouldn't either.

316
00:14:21,362 --> 00:14:22,905
Are you okay, mami?

317
00:14:22,989 --> 00:14:25,742
- I'm- I'm-
- Hey, guys!

318
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:28,161
Now the party's started.
Come on.

319
00:14:28,244 --> 00:14:29,537
How are you?
Good.

320
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,914
You disgust me.
Are you hungry?

321
00:14:31,998 --> 00:14:33,666
Oh, good,
it's still in one piece.

322
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,209
You hit those potholes
pretty hard.

323
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:38,046
It's like you didn't see 'em.
No, I saw 'em.

324
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:39,589
Can I be honest with you, Jay?

325
00:14:39,672 --> 00:14:42,467
I'm getting the sense that you're
not the biggest fan of Alegria.

326
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:45,428
You got a name for it now. Great.
All right, cards on the table?

327
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:47,013
This is not your best work.

328
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:50,308
Now look, don't get me wrong.
You're a talented kid.

329
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:51,893
You're gonna be
a big success in the world.

330
00:14:51,976 --> 00:14:54,145
But this-
it's a swing and a miss.

331
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,980
Well, but my mom said it was-
"It's great."

332
00:14:56,064 --> 00:14:58,316
Yeah, I know.
But how did she say it?

333
00:14:58,441 --> 00:15:00,151
What do you mean?
There's a big difference...

334
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:03,488
between "It's great" and
"It's great"- You hear that?

335
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:06,365
"It's great" and "It's great. "

336
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:08,451
All I hear is a bunch of people
telling me I'm great.

337
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:11,829
And that's a problem, because a lot of times
people will lie to you to protect your feelings,

338
00:15:11,913 --> 00:15:13,539
and that's not doin' you
any favors.

339
00:15:13,623 --> 00:15:15,083
You get a lot farther in life...

340
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,835
if you know what you're good at
and what you're not.

341
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:20,463
Now, you can handle that, right?

342
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:22,882
Yeah.
Of course you can.

343
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:24,425
How you doin', honey?

344
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:26,010
I'm great

345
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,098
Okay, everybody, come on. Two
minutes till dinner. Get ready.

346
00:15:30,181 --> 00:15:31,349
Sounds good.
All righty!

347
00:15:31,432 --> 00:15:33,309
Oh, wow, Manny.
What have you got there?

348
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:34,769
He made a centerpiece.

349
00:15:34,894 --> 00:15:36,979
Oh. That's fantastic.
Stunning.

350
00:15:37,063 --> 00:15:38,481
It's garbage.

351
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:41,609
No, no, no! What are you doing?
it's so beautiful!

352
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:43,778
Stop the lies.
Jay told me the truth.

353
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:45,071
What did you say?

354
00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:46,489
I mentioned it wasn't
his best effort.

355
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:48,074
He said it was
a swing and a miss.

356
00:15:48,157 --> 00:15:51,577
Why? Why do you say these things, Jay?
it's like I married my mother!

357
00:15:51,661 --> 00:15:53,871
- Yeah, Jay, why would you do that?
- Because he's a Pritchett.

358
00:15:53,955 --> 00:15:56,374
But don't let these negative
nellies drag you down, Manny.

359
00:15:56,457 --> 00:15:58,876
Because one day, you could
have a trillion-dollar idea...

360
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,878
that the people who supposedly
love you most-

361
00:16:00,962 --> 00:16:04,132
Okay, Phil. That's it.
Go get the head-scratcher.

362
00:16:04,215 --> 00:16:05,925
The Real Head-Scratcher, T.M.?

363
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:09,762
Go get it, and let everybody else decide
how many trillions I've cost you.

364
00:16:09,846 --> 00:16:11,389
Way ahead of you.

365
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:12,765
So what's goin' on here?

366
00:16:12,849 --> 00:16:15,226
We are about to make hat history.

367
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:18,271
Or as I like to call it,
"hat-story."

368
00:16:18,354 --> 00:16:22,150
Early man had hours and hours
to scratch his weary head.

369
00:16:22,233 --> 00:16:26,028
But what about
today's busy times?

370
00:16:27,071 --> 00:16:29,198
Thank you, squire.
Great thing about this,

371
00:16:29,282 --> 00:16:31,659
you can wear it anywhere.

372
00:16:33,578 --> 00:16:34,871
Hit it, buddy.

373
00:16:34,954 --> 00:16:36,372
Ohh.

374
00:16:36,455 --> 00:16:39,834
It's like a thousand tiny angels
are line dancing on my sca-

375
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:41,836
Aah.

376
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:45,590
Looks like we got a slight
malfunction in a rear nogginizer.

377
00:16:45,673 --> 00:16:48,342
Ohh! Shut her down!
Shut her down, buddy!

378
00:16:48,426 --> 00:16:50,678
It's not working, Dad! My hair!
it's got my hair!

379
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:52,096
Okay!

380
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,015
Fine. I'm fine.

381
00:16:54,098 --> 00:16:56,934
Forgot about that feature.
it's an exfoliating scrub.

382
00:16:57,018 --> 00:16:58,686
Buddy, can you grab
the safety shears?

383
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:00,438
You know what, Phil?
Keep it up.

384
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:02,190
And I admire you and Manny.

385
00:17:02,273 --> 00:17:05,109
I know what it's like to stare
down skepticism from a loved one.

386
00:17:05,193 --> 00:17:06,819
- Cam, not now.
- Why not now?

387
00:17:06,903 --> 00:17:09,363
It's Thanksgiving.
Families gather. Issues come up.

388
00:17:09,447 --> 00:17:10,656
Only if you bring them up.

389
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,867
It's healthy to get
things out in the open.

390
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,244
Y'all know my punkin chunkin' story
or do you need a refresher?

391
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,829
We've heard it.
Oh, several times.

392
00:17:16,913 --> 00:17:19,707
I love it,
with Cody and the friends.

393
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,292
Yes. So you know how it ends.

394
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,337
But the question is,
who here thinks I made that up?

395
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,172
Oh.

396
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:29,592
Oh, well. Doesn't that tell
the whole story right there?

397
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:31,510
Here we have the skeptics.

398
00:17:31,594 --> 00:17:34,388
The dream squashers.
The Pritchetts.

399
00:17:34,472 --> 00:17:38,226
And here we have the dreamers,
the artists, the visionaries.

400
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:40,061
Sweet Caroline!

401
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:44,982
So we're supposed to believe that you make
a pumpkin fly across a football field?

402
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:47,026
I can prove it right now.
Let's go to the football field.

403
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:49,320
- Yes, let's do it. I'd love to end this.
- Let's settle this.

404
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:51,405
Dreamers versus Pritchetts.
Yeah!

405
00:17:51,489 --> 00:17:53,407
Let's go!
Oh, no, no, no, no!

406
00:17:53,491 --> 00:17:55,660
No, no, no!

407
00:17:55,743 --> 00:17:58,746
I did not just cook
for eight hours...

408
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:01,999
so you people could run off
to prove some asinine point...

409
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,918
that's only gonna make
half of us feel bad.

410
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:06,963
Come on!
Show a little respect.

411
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:12,426
Turkey smells great,
sweetheart.

412
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,596
Is that turkey? Because
something smells like chicken.

413
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:17,890
Okay, let's settle this.
Yeah.

414
00:18:17,974 --> 00:18:21,018
Vamos! Vamos!
Jay, I drive!

415
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:23,771
This is the coolest thing ever.

416
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:25,356
Okay, I want to film.

417
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:26,941
Ay, no, wait.
I want to be in it.

418
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:28,693
Hey, Cam, are you sure
this is going to work?

419
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:31,028
Oh, God, you sound
just like Cody.

420
00:18:31,112 --> 00:18:32,822
Do you think this
could launch a human?

421
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:34,490
Oh, Luke.

422
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:36,450
Let's do the pumpkin first.
Okay.

423
00:18:36,534 --> 00:18:39,745
They're havin' fun over there,
but you know it's gonna end in tears.

424
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,707
Yeah, always does. Knock, knock.
Who's there? Physics.

425
00:18:42,832 --> 00:18:44,292
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

426
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:46,752
Who's gonna be able to launch it?
I think it should be Cam.

427
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:49,380
No, I think it should be all of us!
All of us! All of us!

428
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:50,840
Yeah!
Yeah!

429
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:54,260
For the record, I don't
squash all of Phil's dreams.

430
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:56,345
Just the ones that are,
you know, potentially fatal.

431
00:18:56,429 --> 00:18:58,306
I'm just trying to get
the kid ready for life.

432
00:18:58,389 --> 00:19:01,225
Yeah, if we didn't do this
to them, the world would.

433
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:03,561
Okay, everybody
in final launching positions?

434
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:05,604
Get ready to eat some crow!

435
00:19:05,688 --> 00:19:07,606
It is not as delicious
as it sounds.

436
00:19:08,691 --> 00:19:11,736
Okay. Uno, dos, tres!

437
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:13,738
Three!
Yeah!

438
00:19:16,157 --> 00:19:19,201
What happened, Cam? I-I don't know.
I-I don't know.

439
00:19:19,285 --> 00:19:20,870
Can we do it again?

440
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:23,789
No. We only had one punkin
and we just chunk it.

441
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:27,084
Well, we were right.
Oh, my. Yeah.

442
00:19:28,586 --> 00:19:30,338
I'm sorry, guys-

443
00:19:30,421 --> 00:19:32,673
This usually feels
a little better, doesn't it?

444
00:19:32,757 --> 00:19:34,342
Yeah.
Uh-huh.

445
00:19:34,425 --> 00:19:35,885
All right, I hate to admit it,

446
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:38,679
but when they put the pumpkin in, I
was kind of hoping it would work.

447
00:19:38,763 --> 00:19:40,598
Yeah.
Me too.

448
00:19:40,723 --> 00:19:42,016
Huh.  All right.

449
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:43,684
Let the gloating begin.

450
00:19:43,768 --> 00:19:45,478
You know,
it was a pretty good try.

451
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:47,271
We don't need your pity.

452
00:19:47,355 --> 00:19:49,065
Let's just get this stuff cleaned up.

453
00:19:49,148 --> 00:19:50,191
Yeah.

454
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:53,694
Oh- Well,
or if maybe we, um-

455
00:19:53,778 --> 00:19:55,780
we launch it
from a steeper angle.

456
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:58,449
Maybe if you had somebody else,
you know, helping you pull the thing.

457
00:19:58,574 --> 00:20:01,243
We don't have any more pumpkins.
That's the easy part.

458
00:20:01,327 --> 00:20:03,996
They're on every porch
up and down the block.

459
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,456
We can handle that.
Come on, kid.

460
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:06,874
Come on. Let's try one. Okay.

461
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:08,167
All right.
All right!

462
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,503
I say "punkin,"
gang says "chunkin'!"

463
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:14,340
There are dreamers and
there are realists in this World.

464
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:16,467
You'd think the dreamers
would find the dreamers...

465
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,094
and the realists
would find the realists,

466
00:20:18,177 --> 00:20:21,555
but more often than not,
the opposite is true.

467
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:23,891
Maybe if this works, we should
launch my centerpiece next.

468
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:25,184
It wasn't that bad.

469
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:26,977
Your rice pilaf was.

470
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:28,562
Ready. Straight back.

471
00:20:28,646 --> 00:20:30,439
Be careful.

472
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:32,858
All right.
Okay.

473
00:20:32,942 --> 00:20:34,860
Come on, keep going!
Keep going!

474
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:39,240
You see, the dreamers
need the realists...

475
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:41,409
to keep them from soaring
too close to the sun.

476
00:20:41,492 --> 00:20:43,869
And the realists?

477
00:20:43,953 --> 00:20:46,122
Well, without the dreamers,

478
00:20:46,205 --> 00:20:48,207
they might not ever
get off the ground.

479
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:56,048
Next one's going through the-
the goal thingy. I can feel it.

480
00:20:59,677 --> 00:21:01,762
Now, when Lorna,
Cody and I did this-

481
00:21:01,846 --> 00:21:03,264
Less talkin', more chunkin'.

482
00:21:03,389 --> 00:21:05,099
Mom, I need to tell you something.
What is it?

483
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:06,183
Ready?

484
00:21:06,267 --> 00:21:07,935
I distracted Haley
while she was driving...

485
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:10,146
- and we dented your car.
- Fire!

486
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:15,317
Ohh!

487
00:21:15,401 --> 00:21:16,902
Yeah!

488
00:21:16,986 --> 00:21:19,196
Well, girls,

489
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,907
three more seconds, and you
would've gotten away with it.

490
00:21:21,991 --> 00:21:23,409
Mmm.
Mmm.

491
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:25,202
Now a human?

492
00:21:25,286 --> 00:21:27,371
Come here, Lily.  Luke,no.

493
00:21:32,293 --> 00:21:33,294
English - US - PSDH
