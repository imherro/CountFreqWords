1
00:00:02,878 --> 00:00:04,471
Did you see it?

2
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:05,798
Does she know?

3
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:08,475
This is the last thing
she needs today.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,177
No!

5
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:12,976
Busy day at the Dunphy compound. We have
a wedding tonight, and this afternoon,

6
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:15,979
Claire is debating Duane Bailey
in the race for town council.

7
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:20,279
And now the Weekly Saver says
that some voters find Claire,

8
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:23,654
quote, "Angry and unlikable."

9
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:26,986
To those voters I say,
wait till she sees this.

10
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:29,822
No one can mention it
to her.

11
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:33,500
We can't have some unscientific
poll shaking Claire's confidence.

12
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,373
Phil. What poll?

13
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,954
Too late.
She knows.

14
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,711
- Who told her?
- What is this, a witch hunt?

15
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,758
Oh, my God.

16
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,551
I have to go.

17
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,880
Well, I just don't think
it's a big deal.

18
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:47,840
I mean, how many people
read the Weekly-

19
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:49,808
Saver?
Saver anyway?

20
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,931
22,000-ish.

21
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:54,350
My company advert-

22
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,148
used to advertise
with that newspaper.

23
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,898
And how am I angry and unlikable?

24
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,149
Can I take this one?

25
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,026
I wouldn't.
You seem angry now.

26
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:04,732
I am angry- at that poll.

27
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:07,409
I think it's the yelling.
I would tone down the yelling.

28
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,111
Honey, I don't yell
for no reason.

29
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,663
You yelled at my teacher
for calling me special.

30
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,832
Honey, that was not
a compliment.

31
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,001
Sweetheart,
you're not unlikable.

32
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,168
Thank you.

33
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,372
You just seem unlikable.
But if we work on it,

34
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,172
it's totally fixable.
How? How?

35
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:22,921
Phil, how are we gonna
work on it?

36
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,918
First of all, lose the
snippy attitude. Mm-hmm.

37
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,879
Then, I don't know, maybe
we could have a mock debate.

38
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:29,761
Oh, good idea. That way Morn can
rehearse her views on the issues.

39
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,593
Yeah, and we can point out all the little
things she does that turn people off.

40
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:35,304
Like that look.
I would lose that look.

41
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,267
Spooky, but better.

42
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:43,020
# Hey, hey #

43
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,105
# Hey, hey #

44
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:47,236
# Hey, hey #

45
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:49,159
# Hey, hey #

46
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,406
# Hey ##

47
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,869
All right.
Thank you very much.

48
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,792
Hey, Lily.
Come here, honey.

49
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:00,246
Hi. Do you know what this is?

50
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,247
A box.
Containing?

51
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:05,751
She doesn't know "containing." Well, that's
how she learns new words- by us using them.

52
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:09,714
Or that's how we lower her self-esteem- by
bombarding her with confusing vocabulary.

53
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,594
What's the box containing?

54
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,392
Told you.
Okay. it's your dress.

55
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,687
It's finally here.
Ah!

56
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:19,982
It's every little girl's dream
to be a flower girl in a wedding.

57
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,775
It's Lily's chance to shine.

58
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,898
I was a three-time
ring bearer.

59
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,480
It's Lily's chance to shine.

60
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,449
Oh!

61
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,821
Pretty.

62
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,198
Oh, no. Cam, Cam.

63
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,664
She's gonna look like Little Bo Peep.
Or Little Bo Cheap.

64
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,582
Look at this fabric.
It's already pilling.

65
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,126
Maybe it'll look better on.

66
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,124
You mean ... turned on?

67
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,542
No, it does not. Cam!
Oh!

68
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:45,624
- I love it!
- No, you don't.

69
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,085
Oh, my gosh. Are we really
gonna let her wear this?

70
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,296
You know what? If the bride
wants to have a tacky wedding,

71
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:51,631
she can have a tacky wedding.

72
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,302
Lily will be the bright spot.
Literally.

73
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:55,055
Heard it as soon as
I said it.

74
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,682
Stella!

75
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,102
Where's my good girl?

76
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,606
Gloria, is Stella up there?

77
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,938
No. But I am.

78
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,739
Why don't you say hello
to your wife when you come home?

79
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:12,659
Well, why don't you greet me
at the door, wagging your tail?

80
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,283
Stella, honey, where are you?

81
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,363
Stella!

82
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,908
My baby!

83
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,414
Stella, I'm coming.
I'm coming.

84
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,918
Okay? You okay?

85
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,754
Why are you
swimming in your clothes?

86
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:36,308
Because I'm self-conscious about my body.
Stella fell in the pool.

87
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:40,138
It's my fault. I let her out, and
then I got caught up in my couponing.

88
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,269
Any coupons for swim lessons?
'Cause Stella needs some.

89
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,852
Seriously. Manny you teach to
swim by throwing him in the pool,

90
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,313
but the dog
gets swimming lessons?

91
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,990
I gotta say, it was
unpleasant but effective.

92
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,409
We have to teach Stella how to
swim, otherwise she could drown.

93
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,737
Why don't you teach her
not to jump in the pool?

94
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,788
She didn't jump in the pool.
She fell in the pool.

95
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,834
Why suddenly would she jump in the pool
when she doesn't know how to swim?

96
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,956
Why does she bark at the vacuum?

97
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,538
It's a thing. it's never
going to play with you.

98
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,715
Are you saying
that Stella is stupid?

99
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,881
Are you covering her ears? Let's
have a little compassion.

100
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,804
She's probably still traumatized
from her near-death experience.

101
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,679
Again? What's happening?

102
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,760
¡Ay, no!

103
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:23,480
Welcome, candidates. Mrs. Dunphy.
Thank you for having me.

104
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:26,058
- And Councilman Bailey.
- Gosh, thank you so much, Alex.

105
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,769
I'm deeply honored to be here,
and I remain, as ever,

106
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,822
a humble servant to the greatest
little town in the greatest darn-

107
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,275
Eye rolling.

108
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,075
Playful eye rolling.

109
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:39,280
Uh, how do we, as voters, know it's playful?
I would avoid it.

110
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,078
Okay. No eye rolling.

111
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,376
And don't purse your lips like that.
It makes you look annoyed.

112
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,498
Mm-hmm.

113
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,464
And don't touch your face. Yeah,
no face touching. Seems nervous.

114
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,007
Some of this is subjective.

115
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:53,836
What? What now? Finger.

116
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,047
It looks like you're scolding us.

117
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,802
I will keep my hands
at my sides.

118
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,051
Not on your hips. You're not Superman.

119
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,018
Can we get started?
We haven't started?

120
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,892
- I've prepared some questions.
- Oh, goody. Actual questions.

121
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,766
Honk. Sarcasm.
Just go.

122
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:11,524
Okay, Mrs. Dunphy, why are you
running for local office?

123
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,446
Okay, that's, um-
that's good.

124
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,490
L, um-

125
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,489
Mom, you really shouldn't stutter
over a basic question like that.

126
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,320
You should at least
know why you're running.

127
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,405
I thought the moderator
was supposed to be objective.

128
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:25,663
Not if she's the only one in the room
who has actual debate experience.

129
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:29,212
- Now, why are you running?
- I saw the need for a stop sign-

130
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,127
Liar!
Phil.

131
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,959
I just think you should
be ready for anything.

132
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,802
I saw the need for a-

133
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:38,255
- What?
- Sorry. Accidental buzz.

134
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,306
I saw the need for a stop
sign in my neighborhood,

135
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,430
and although I collected
the necessary signatures ...

136
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,637
and did the paperwork, I found local
government to be entirely unhelpful.

137
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,897
What?
Too long. I'm bored.

138
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,396
Yeah, next question.
I feel like I'm in school.

139
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,066
Some say the political system
is bogged down ...

140
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,612
by ideological hard-liners unwilling
to compromise. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

141
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,991
How would you respond to that,
Councilman Bailey?

142
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,323
I would like to use
my lifeline.

143
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,829
I'll take this.
If elected,

144
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,831
I would consider
all perspectives,

145
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,538
and I would not ignore
opposing viewpoints.

146
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:14,625
Helicopter. Just keep going.

147
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,961
I would consider all
perspectives, and I wouldn't-

148
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,590
- You suck!
- Luke!

149
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,093
- You have to be ready for hecklers.
- He's right.

150
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,675
Mmm. Okay, I'm doing over.
No buzzing.

151
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,510
If elected, I-

152
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,355
What?
Too close to the mike.

153
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,020
Phil, it's a hairbrush.
Okay.

154
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:36,234
If elected, I would
consider all opinions ...

155
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,236
and not ignore those
of the opposition,

156
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,943
as Councilman Bailey
has done for six terms.

157
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,035
What? That
was a great answer.

158
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:47,491
Well, I couldn't hear it because you were
showing me the bad side of your face, so-

159
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,710
I have a bad side?
Yeah, the left.

160
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,832
- No, it's the right.
- Dad, it's totally the left.

161
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,882
- I mean, look at it.
- Sweetheart, why do you think I chose my side of the bed?

162
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,549
Okay, okay. Thank you.
Thank you, family.

163
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,218
This has been
super-duper helpful.

164
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,011
Hands, lips, sarcasm,

165
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,713
eye rolling,
wrong side of the face.

166
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,682
Oh, yeah. Now I see it.

167
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,260
Yeah.

168
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,938
She's ready.

169
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:14,894
And it's this, and it's this.

170
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:18,025
Not this, but this.

171
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,822
Okay.
Okay, that's good, Cam.

172
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,242
Save- Save some petals
for Lily, all right?

173
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,111
Let's do it over here, sweetheart.
Try, honey. Okay.

174
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,704
There you go. Like you're coming
down the aisle! Yeah, yeah.

175
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,327
Okay.

176
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,579
Not too many at once.
You're doing great, Lil.

177
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,623
Oh, she is, isn't she?
Forget the bride.

178
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,545
All the eyes
are gonna be on her.

179
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,419
Oh-

180
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,477
I cannot believe you laughed!
I am sorry.

181
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:55,771
children cursing and old people rapping.

182
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,611
Cam, we have to tell her
it's a bad word. No.

183
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:01,406
That just gives it more power.
The less we make of it, the better.

184
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,358
Let's just pretend
like it never happened.

185
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,193
Okay, well, maybe it-
maybe it didn't.

186
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,320
Maybe we- Maybe we misheard.
Yeah.

187
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,281
Maybe she said "truck" ...

188
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,741
or- or "duck."

189
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,543
Or "luck."
She could've said "yuck."

190
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,495
Daddy, can I have
some ice cream?

191
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,956
No, honey, if you're hungry,
you can have some fruit.

192
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,542
Fruit-

193
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,502
Oh, God!

194
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,259
I have two children.

195
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,563
Phil. Phil,
is this televised?

196
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,016
I didn't tell you because I
didn't want to make you nervous.

197
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,978
Great plan. Really. Good plan, throwing
me for a curveball at the last minute.

198
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,150
Mom, chill. It's just public access.
Mm-hmm.

199
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,529
My debate team's on public access, and the
only people who watch me are you guys.

200
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,778
Yep, all the time.
So maybe nobody'll see this?

201
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,489
No, we want people to see this.
That's how you win elections.

202
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,119
That's the whole point.

203
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,828
Then Mom should do something
so crazy and stupid it goes viral.

204
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,960
- Mom, please don't go viral.
- Okay, I'll add that to my list of things not to do.

205
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,168
Don't touch my face,
don't roll my eyes,

206
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,094
don't point my fingers,
and definitely don't go viral.

207
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,888
Do any of you
still believe in me?

208
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,886
Of course we do.
We're on your side.

209
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,218
The right side,
not the left.

210
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,144
Let's grab a seat.

211
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,892
Here we go.

212
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:18,316
- Right. Not left.
- Okay. Mom, just be confident.

213
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:22,441
Based on what? I just lost a debate in my
living room, and people think I'm unlikable.

214
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,740
That's just the word men use for powerful
women because they feel threatened.

215
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:29,570
So just forget everything else
and be proud and powerful.

216
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,781
- How did you get so smart?
- I've always assumed adoption or baby switch.

217
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:35,162
- Mmm.
- Hey, hey. No kisses.

218
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,743
- Proud and powerful.
- Sorry.

219
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:39,917
And no apologizing. Yes.
Shut up and get in there.

220
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,506
That's more like it.
Uh-huh.

221
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,751
Yeah.

222
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,426
Oh, God.

223
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,889
- There she is. Go get 'em, Claire.
- Hi. Thanks.

224
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,513
Don't worry, we're going to cheer
for you, no matter what you say.

225
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,391
Oh, good. More support
from my loving family.

226
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,690
Honk. Sarcasm.
Why'd you bring Stella?

227
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,938
She keeps getting out
and jumping in the pool.

228
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,190
We don't want to take any
chances, because she can't swim.

229
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,271
Then why does she keep
jumping in the pool?

230
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:08,484
I've been thinking about it. I got a theory.
She might be suicidal.

231
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,489
What? That's crazy.

232
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,822
There's "not" such thing
as doggy suicide.

233
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:17,876
Hi. Duane Bailey. Uh, sorry. I
couldn't help but overhear.

234
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,669
In addition to being
a public servant,

235
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,497
I'm also an award-winning
breeder of Puggles.

236
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,753
I won the Puggly- twice.

237
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,962
And I'm afraid that doggy
suicide is all too real.

238
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,718
It's just the mainstream media
doesn't report on it ...

239
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,300
'cause it's not as sexy
as feline AIDS.

240
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,136
Stella is not suicidal.
She's just stupid.

241
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,187
Well, that might be
part of your problem.

242
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,773
She senses you don't like her.
You have no idea.

243
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,773
This one's been against this little
angel from the very beginning.

244
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:47,152
Yeah, well, dogs pick up on that.
You know, they're very sensitive.

245
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,076
I like to call them, um-
bottomless pits of need.

246
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,404
But not to their face though.
That would just destroy them.

247
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,080
- Not you.
- So now this is my fault?

248
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,625
I think he knows what he's talking about.
The man won a Puggly.

249
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,334
Two. I won two-
We're done here.

250
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,670
In two thousand-
Yeah.

251
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,464
Do you have any idea
what station this is on?

252
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,167
Oh, here, I'll look online.

253
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,969
It's a webcast? That would have been
helpful to know 900 channels ago.

254
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,842
No, it's on public access
or something.

255
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,719
I want to watch Aunt Claire.

256
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,017
Okay. Well, first, honey, we
need to talk about something.

257
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,935
It's about that word
you said this morning.

258
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:21,106
- What word?
- You know, the one that starts with

259
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,980
Flower?
No.

260
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,605
Fruit?
No.

261
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,608
If she doesn't remember it,
we shouldn't remind her.

262
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,564
Oh, well, she said it
three times.

263
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,194
Oh, you mean-

264
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,948
Cam, leave the room.

265
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,827
No. I can do this.

266
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,375
- Lily, that is a bad word.
- Bad word.

267
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,748
And you are not allowed
to say it ever.

268
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,831
- But it makes you laugh.
- Okay, well, Daddy shouldn't be laughing,

269
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,167
and you should never
say that word.

270
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,344
- Do you understand?
- Maybe.

271
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,763
Okay, this is not a game,
all right?

272
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,180
If you say that word one more time, I'm
gonna take away all your toys. I'm serious.

273
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,179
She knows I'm not serious.
What about the wedding?

274
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,855
What if she says it there?
She's like a ticking time bomb.

275
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:05,775
- What are we gonna do? Cancel?
- Yes. Maybe we just call and say ...

276
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,228
we're not going to any more weddings
until the gays can get married.

277
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,904
Oh, so now we're political.

278
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:13,324
We leave town on gay pride weekend
because we don't like the traffic.

279
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:22,497
But there's no substitute
for experience.

280
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,203
For example, I doubt
my opponent is familiar with ...

281
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,709
town ordinance 26-12B.

282
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:30,338
26-12B has to do
with noise pollution,

283
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,885
something, sir, that
you are guilty of right now.

284
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,889
Oh, no, she didn't!
Go, Mom!

285
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,717
- Ladies and gentlemen-
- Look at her eyes.

286
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,304
I know. They're a little too close together.
It's been bugging me for years.

287
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,685
No. She's in the zone.
She's ready for anything.

288
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,358
I do like to talk-
about the issues.

289
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:51,859
Uh, speaking of issues, your
husband seems to have some. Hmm.

290
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,281
I'm sorry?

291
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,279
Am not sorry.

292
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:56,860
- What?
- Oh.

293
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,992
Well, I wouldn't want to bring
it up, but since you ask, um,

294
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,948
in February of last year,
your husband,

295
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,204
one, uh, Phillip Dunphy,

296
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,412
was questioned
at a local hotel ...

297
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:09,418
for lewd
and lascivious conduct.

298
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,840
Oh, geez.

299
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,836
That's not true. Ma'am, according
to this police report,

300
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,717
he, uh, broke into
a stranger's room,

301
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:21,142
stripped naked and then posed
provocatively on the bed.

302
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,306
That is technically true.

303
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:29,393
But in all fairness,
it was Valentine's Day.

304
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,024
Oh, oh. I'm- I'm so sorry.
It was Valentine's Day.

305
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:36,859
I'm not sure if your husband was born in
this country- perhaps he snuck in illegally-

306
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,616
but here in America, we celebrate
Valentines Day with chocolates,

307
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,868
not our private parts.
Mmm.

308
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,706
This is my new favorite show.
Shh!

309
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,459
No, sir. He was looking
for me, his wife,

310
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,415
and he walked into
the wrong room.

311
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,297
If you believe that, I have some
talking Puggles I'd like to sell you.

312
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,845
Do you believe this?

313
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,797
Talking dogs?
I'm skeptical.

314
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:02,009
I won the Puggly- twice.
Be strong.

315
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,766
I am glad that my opponent
brought this up,

316
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:10,646
as I feel that it speaks to
his character more than mine.

317
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:13,569
I think that we should raise
the level of discourse ...

318
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:16,147
and get back to the issues that
the voters really care about.

319
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,779
When he was naked,
what were you wearing?

320
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,860
I don't think
that's relevant.

321
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:26,495
- Are you sex freaks?
- My personal life has nothing to do with this.

322
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,167
Uh-

323
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,244
My opponent
has brought this up ...

324
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,672
to distract
from his own record,

325
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,920
which shows that
in- in six years,

326
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,673
he has achieved nothing more
than writing one ordinance ...

327
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:41,006
that allows private parties
to have more than eight dogs.

328
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:44,138
- Hmm. Hmm. - it's like
watching the Hindenburg.

329
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,265
It's the most horrible thing
I've ever seen in my life.

330
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,480
Excuse me.
Stand by.

331
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,353
I am Phil Dunphy,
and I am not a pervert.

332
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:56,063
I, like a lot of men
in this town,

333
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,113
enjoy making love
to my wife.

334
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,284
I mean, uh-
I mean with their wives.

335
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,533
Not me. Them.

336
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:08,742
Look. I should probably just sit down
and say nothing, but it's too late.

337
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,374
I am standing,
and I'm obviously talking,

338
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,547
and now you're looking at me, and
I feel the need to keep going.

339
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:19,761
First of
all, no charges were filed.

340
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,965
Everyone had a good laugh-
about the situation.

341
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,096
Not- Not about me.
Everything's fine down there.

342
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,802
Anyhoo.

343
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,225
Where were we?

344
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,398
All over YouTube.

345
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:36,315
We went viral.
Some sick bastard Auto-Tuned me.

346
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:39,614
# I, like a lot of men in this town #

347
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:42,784
# I enhoy making love
to my wife- wife #

348
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,950
# And I don't know how to stop #

349
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,032
# I am a pervert
Pervert
Per- #

350
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:55,417
Jay, Manny, we should have
been there already.

351
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,919
Gloria, I'm tying my tie!

352
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:00,001
I'm accessorizing.

353
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,462
And I thought I was the woman.

354
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,764
The door!

355
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:11,221
¡Ay!
Stella, no, no!

356
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,682
¡Ay, no, no!
Stella, don't do it.

357
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:18,144
Don't kill yourself. You are a
perfectly fine dog. I don't hate you.

358
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:22,107
Stella, okay, I was a little mean to you,
but that's no reason to kill yourself.

359
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:26,070
You are young. You still
have so much left to smell.

360
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,199
¡Ay!

361
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,164
I-I go! I'm coming!

362
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,287
I'm- Manny!

363
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,744
¡Ay! Come on, Stella!

364
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,664
What happened?
Are you okay?

365
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,499
She did it again.

366
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,459
And you jumped in
to save her.

367
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,796
No, Jay. I wanted to take a little
swim before going to the wedding.

368
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,973
Get her a towel.
She's shaking like a leaf.

369
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:55,102
Oh, no, no.
I meant- I meant-

370
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:58,526
Thank you, Jay.
The dog towel for me.

371
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:01,070
For the wife.

372
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,110
- Hi.
- Hey, guys. Hi.

373
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:08,737
Hi. Hey, what's shakin'?
What's cookin'?

374
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,787
You saw the debate,
didn't you?

375
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:12,282
The de-what?
No, that wasn't-

376
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,784
Was that on today? That was today.
Oh, I didn't remember.

377
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,619
You are the worst liars.

378
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,249
It was phenomenal television.

379
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,751
Oh, Lily.

380
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,504
What a ... dress.

381
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,632
Oh, well.
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

382
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,472
How 'bout there?

383
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,676
- Wow.
- Yikes.

384
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,261
- She looks like a Lite-Brite.
- Luke, honey.

385
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,312
Lily, sweetie, are you
excited to be a flower girl?

386
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,312
Yeah?
You a little bit nervous?

387
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,984
Yeah?

388
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,482
Why isn't she talking to me?
Did she see the debate too?

389
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,690
Nope, she's on verbal lockdown.
Oh.

390
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,070
She's been dropping
a certain curse word all day.

391
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,278
Yeah. Yeah, so we're just hoping the next
one doesn't happen during the wedding.

392
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:53,740
If it does, it'll be the second most embarrassing
thing to happen to our family today.

393
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,700
Phil, you said
it wasn't that bad.

394
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:59,420
That was in the car. We're
in a church now. Honey.

395
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,998
Somebody turn her off.
I think I'm having a seizure.

396
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,833
Oh, buddy. Oh. Yeah.

397
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,338
Oh, good. I thought that we
were going to miss Lily.

398
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,174
Ships at sea wouldn't miss Lily.
Where have you guys been?

399
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:14,227
I had to jump in the pool
to save that stupid dog.

400
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,845
Who she loves.
Ay-

401
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,772
That I didn't let her drown
doesn't mean that I love her.

402
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:22,728
I barely got Manny back in the
pool after that possum incident.

403
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,155
I thought it drowned, but turns
out it was just playing possum.

404
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,948
Yes, papi.

405
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,711
Good job.

406
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:51,677
You know what the
worst part of today was?

407
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,429
I imagine
it's hard to choose.

408
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,100
When everything
was melting down,

409
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:58,851
I realized I had an answer to
your question- why I was running.

410
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:02,809
I wanted to make my family proud,
and I did the exact opposite.

411
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,982
No. No, I did. I totally
embarrassed you.

412
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,565
No. No, Dad
embarrassed me.

413
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,616
I was proud of you.

414
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,614
I think it's cool you're
running for local office.

415
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:16,288
I mean, it's totally nerdy,
and that's kind of my thing.

416
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,617
Mmm. Maybe
it's kind of our thing.

417
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:30,754
Someday I'll
walk you down the aisle.

418
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,930
If you're not in perv jail.

419
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,018
Please be seated.

420
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,936
Friends, family,
thank you for-

421
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:46,436
Really? Well, you know
I cry at weddings.

422
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,237
Oh, no. What?

423
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:51,733
Stop. Stop crying. Just because you have
ice water in your veins doesn't mean-

424
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,489
No, no, Lily.

425
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,240
No, Lily.
He's fine.

426
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:58,080
Daddy's not sad.
Daddy, Daddy.

427
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,053
See? I told you it was funny.

428
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,651
There, that oughta do it.

429
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,484
Go on, you little motorboat.

430
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,911
Ah, look at her go.

431
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,580
Where's she goin'? Ah, geez.

432
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,908
I think she's tryin' to get
herself sucked into the filter.

433
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,493
What'd you say to her?

434
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,203
I didn't say anything.

435
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:46,879
Wait a second.

436
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,376
Jay, look!

437
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,044
See?

438
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,377
She was not trying
to kill herself.

439
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,304
She was just trying to get
to the squeaky wiener.

440
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,756
That must be why
she's been jumping in.

441
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:59,217
It must have been there
all the time. That's hilarious.

442
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,802
¡Ay, sí!

443
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,349
No, it's not!
Not now.

444
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,227
I'm saying it will be.

445
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:06,899
Later.

446
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,357
