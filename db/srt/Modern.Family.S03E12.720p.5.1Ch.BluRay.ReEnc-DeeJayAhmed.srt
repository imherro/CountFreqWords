1
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:04,631
So the five keys
to investing wisely ...

2
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:07,512
in a down real estate
market are:

3
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:11,308
"Keyp" your cool.
Mm-hmm.

4
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,480
"Keyp" informed.

5
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:16,184
Legwork.

6
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:19,395
I recently became a partner
in a new agency,

7
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:23,858
so I put together a seminar
to recruit first-time home buyers.

8
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:25,864
I want to give 'em
a step-by-step description ...

9
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:28,366
of exactly what I can do for them.

10
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:31,699
Am I worried that they might write it
all down and just do it themselves?

11
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:35,832
Quite frankly, I hadn't thought
about it until just now.

12
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:37,538
- Do I really have to go to this thing?
- Yes.

13
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,464
You're a big part of today.
You're my support staff.

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,292
Then why am I not getting paid?

15
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,218
Mmm!
That is a good question,

16
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:46,422
and I think I'm gonna text you the
answer on that cell phone we pay for.

17
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:48,553
- again?
- Uh, no.

18
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:50,305
It's just one question. I think I got it.

19
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,227
Yeah, but it's the most important question ...

20
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,054
because it launches me into my big finish.

21
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,730
Yes. That way, people
leave excited.

22
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:59,481
Oh, I think people
will be excited to leave.

23
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,942
Luke, why?

24
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,617
I'm sorry. It's for school.

25
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:09,195
I have to design a container ...

26
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:11,155
that'll protect an egg in a one-story drop.

27
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:14,367
Yeah, so, um, you thought
you would go with an egg carton?

28
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:17,373
What if the best idea was
under my nose the whole time?

29
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,204
You're gonna need to come down
and clean this up now.

30
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:21,256
I wouldn't have
to do any of this ...

31
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,175
if Alex would just let me use hers
from when she took the class.

32
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:27,425
Never. That design
is my intellectual property.

33
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:30,098
I think it has applications
for unmanned space flight.

34
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,642
Keep talking like that and
you'll go through life unmanned.

35
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,102
Funny.  Girls.

36
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,645
Luke, honey, listen to me.

37
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:38,349
You're gonna need to do this project
on your own, and you can do it.

38
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,402
- Just really think.
- I've got it.

39
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,149
What if I'm the container?

40
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,730
There's a thought. You could be-

41
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,232
No, Luke! Luke!

42
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,402
# Hey, hey #

43
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,579
# Hey, hey #

44
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,531
# Hey, hey #

45
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,492
# Hey, hey #

46
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:57,997
# Hey ##

47
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,803
Okay.  Mwah, mwah, mwah!

48
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:17,100
I understood "crazy old witch, go
kill yourself," then "I love you."

49
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,477
I'll never get this-
how you all yell at each other.

50
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,560
Ay. That's how you know
that your family loves you-

51
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,395
when they feel free
to scream at you.

52
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,355
I guess I owe my ex-wife an apology.

53
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,236
Apparently she was nuts about me.

54
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,901
Darn it!

55
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,783
Try the next one over a frying pan.
I could use some breakfast.

56
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,239
This is so frustrating.

57
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,040
At least you're getting
your hands dirty for a change.

58
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,538
It is a nice break from the life
of the mind I usually live.

59
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:41,086
That's the spirit.

60
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,129
Plus, it's a metaphor
for the human condition.

61
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:46,129
Aren't we all just fragile eggs hiding
behind bubble wrap and bravado?

62
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,755
And we're back.

63
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,713
I'm sure that your egg-droppy thing
is going to be the best in the class.

64
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,931
Uh, except for Luke's.
Really?

65
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,054
Our Luke?

66
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,101
But isn't he like a little-

67
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,770
I bet Claire's gonna help him,

68
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,689
just like she did with his self-portrait
for art class.

69
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,984
There was life in those eyes.
It was haunting.

70
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:06,357
Tell you what.
I'm gonna nip this in the bud.

71
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:10,403
You deserve a fighting chance.

72
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:13,531
Hey, I'm callin' about that egg
project the boys are doing.

73
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,203
Parents aren 't supposed
to help out on that, right?

74
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,780
Why would the parents
be helping?

75
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,786
Why do they cut grapes
for eight-year-olds ?

76
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,744
I figure if you can eat a chicken finger,
you can tear your way through a grape.

77
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,711
Again, Dad?
Aw, I'm sorry.

78
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:26,256
It just bugs me, is all.

79
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,299
The point is, I'm not helping,

80
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,719
and I hope no one else
is helping either.

81
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,922
Okay, Dad.
Thanks for the heads-up.

82
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,052
Love ya. Bye-bye-

83
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,510
Well, my Dad is doing
Manny's project for him.

84
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,185
He called to tell you that?

85
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:41,480
Oh, no. He called to tell me
that he wasn't,

86
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,683
which is exactly what you say
when you are ...

87
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,517
but you don't want anybody
to suspect it.

88
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,144
Really?
Mm-hmm.

89
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,821
What would you say
if you had issues with your father?

90
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,399
Claire and Jay
are incredibly competitive.

91
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:56,157
Tennis games, card games, everything.
Who knows why?

92
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,955
Claire is the son
that my dad never had.

93
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,580
I mean, he just wanted someone
who'd throw a ball in the backyard.

94
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:06,289
I did once, but he did not attend.

95
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,174
Looks like fun.

96
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,751
It was, but now it's hard.

97
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,757
Oh, I'm sure you're
gonna do great, buddy.

98
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,925
Claire.

99
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:21,182
I am just showing interest
in our son's project,

100
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,606
which any parent
would think- think- to do.

101
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,183
Thinking, I am,

102
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:30,112
that maybe I should stay here,
in case Luke has any questions.

103
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:33,111
Do you think you can find somebody
else to help you with your seminar?

104
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,658
I don't know.
it's a little last-minute.

105
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,451
You're kinda irreplaceable.

106
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,119
Well, I mean, it's just one question,

107
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,909
and the seminar isn't for two
hours-

108
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,456
Shh, shh, shh.

109
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,080
Hey, Gloria. Quick favor.

110
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,170
Okay. See you later.
Bye-bye.

111
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,122
- What was that?
- Phil.

112
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,629
He needs help with a seminar
that he's giving.

113
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,551
Why can't Claire help him?

114
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,170
He didn't say.
I'll tell you why.

115
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,972
Because she's knee-deep
in Luke's egg-drop project.

116
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,800
She said that she was not going to help.

117
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,430
That's exactly what
I would say to me ...

118
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,638
if I was helping my kid
and didn't want me to know.

119
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,188
Why would you be talking to you?

120
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,607
I'm just saying it's unfair to Manny.

121
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,480
The kid doesn't stand a chance
on his own.

122
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:12,480
I'm tagging in here. Jay, he
doesn't need you to baby him.

123
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,406
I'm just gonna give him a few tips.
Kid, get yourself a snack.

124
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,280
Okay. I'll cut him some grapes.

125
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,611
Damn it!

126
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,321
Not like that, Jay.
Like this. Look.

127
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,577
It just irritates me.
You know what I mean?

128
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,996
We're meeting
with prospective birth mothers.

129
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,548
We've had a few of these meetings,
and they're very nerve-racking.

130
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:34,672
You wanna look good, you wanna
make a good first impression.

131
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,923
Kind of like a first date.

132
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,050
Actually, it's-ifs
the opposite of a first date.

133
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,882
You don't want to have sex,
but you do want a baby.

134
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:45,437
I have to say, Lily is adorable
and such a good eater.

135
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:48,982
Not all the time. She just
happens to love my tuna salad.

136
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,942
Dolphin-safe, of course.

137
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,564
Oh, who cares about that?

138
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,942
Well, I bet the dolphins do.

139
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,820
It's okay to eat tuna,
but not dolphin'?

140
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,993
My theory is, a fish is a fish.

141
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,286
Mmm. Mm-hmm. Well, a
dolphin's actually a mammal.

142
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,707
Tomato, tomahto.

143
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,250
More like tomato, cow.

144
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,246
Can you help me with the
scones in the kitchen? Okay.

145
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,625
Excuse us.

146
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,958
Okay, this is
not really about the scones.

147
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,089
Oh, really? You didn't need
help carrying six scones?

148
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:20,422
No. This is about your need to correct
everyone's every little mistake.

149
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:24,100
I'm sorry. I thought that she
could use a basic biology lesson.

150
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:27,270
Well, let me give you a basic biology lesson.
You and I can't make a baby.

151
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,815
So if she points to a lamp
and calls it Uncle George,

152
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,518
what are you gonna say?

153
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,194
"Pleased to meet you, Uncle George."

154
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,943
Very good. Now let's get
out there, smile, nod ...

155
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,986
and get ourselves a baby.
Okay.

156
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,945
... and those are
your five keys.

157
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:47,283
Now, if there are no
more questions- Ah, yes.

158
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,414
The lovely home buyer right here
on the edge of her seat.

159
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,291
I was wondering-

160
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,958
I was wondering,

161
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,918
is there a sixth key?

162
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,971
As a matter of fact, there is.

163
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,549
We'll work on that.

164
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,805
It's the key to the new home
you purchased below market,

165
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:10,105
thanks to Woosnum,
Keneally and Dunphy.

166
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,853
Bravo.

167
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,934
Fire the confetti
cannon, drop the banner,

168
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,236
autographs, autographs,
autographs, and we're done.

169
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:19,235
We still have like an hour left.
Can I go shopping?

170
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:22,944
No. I have vocal exercises to do, and I
need you to do a sound check for me.

171
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,779
Ay, I was hoping we could go
to my hair salon. it's nearby.

172
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,830
I didn't have time
to finish my hair this morning.

173
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,658
Really? That just happens?

174
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,161
Ooh, and I can get my nails done.
Is it okay?

175
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,961
Okay, sure. Oh, oh!

176
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,381
Could one of you guys stick this
under a chair on your way out?

177
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,084
One of the lucky attendees is going
home with a brand-new mouse pad.

178
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,420
Wait, wait, wait, wait. I don't
want to see which chair.

179
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,346
I want to be blown away,
like everyone else.

180
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,308
Yes.

181
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,227
Now, that is feng shui.

182
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:50,812
Doesn't that feel better?
Oh, yes.

183
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,480
It's wonderful for conversation.

184
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:56,435
Yes, this is nice. It gives the room a
nice flow, which I'm really liking.

185
00:07:56,518 --> 00:08:00,648
Sometimes your furniture
tells you where it wants to be.

186
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,609
Yeah.

187
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,444
Do you mind
if I use your restroom?

188
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,655
Not at all.
It's just down the hall.

189
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:11,867
Just be warned, there's some furniture
in there that kind of likes where it is.

190
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,078
I know it's killing you to do
this whole song and dance,

191
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,958
but I think it's going great.

192
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,505
Cam, there's a limit. Okay?

193
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,424
We already promised her that we
would show her son all 52 states.

194
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,049
Oh, wow, you have a keyboard.
Oh, yes, that's mine.

195
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,130
You're musical. I love that.

196
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,760
It's very important to me.

197
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,184
Oh, well, you're preaching
to the choir- literally.

198
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,385
I've sung in several.

199
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,391
Yeah, we sing
to Lily all the time.

200
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,482
I wish I could hear you guys.
Oh, well, that's very sweet.

201
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,434
No, now.

202
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,190
The baby's father is a musician,

203
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:42,273
and I would love to know that he's
growing up in a musical household.

204
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,033
Okay.

205
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,362
Great!

206
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,865
Okay, now we're actually doing a song and dance.
Okay, look at it this way.

207
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,450
We're not only adopting a baby,

208
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,286
we're saving it from a life spent
searching for East Dakota.

209
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,214
Oh, God.
This is actually nice.

210
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,007
This is actually very nice
to lean on.

211
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,215
It broke again.

212
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,383
Mmm.
Yes, I saw.

213
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,431
You just need to double up
on the cotton.

214
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,725
Here, let me
save you a step.

215
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:13,686
Alex!

216
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,264
Knock, knock!

217
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,098
Dad! Hey, what are you doing here?

218
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,560
Manny needs that soldering
iron I lent to Phil.

219
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,316
One of the screws on his
project keeps coming loose.

220
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:23,984
But other than that, it's flawless.
Huh.

221
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,738
His latest test run-
he dropped it off the roof.

222
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,069
He walked downstairs.
It hadn't landed yet.

223
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:32,122
I had nothin'.
I had to get in Claire's head.

224
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:35,417
Sometimes the best thing
to do in a race to the top ...

225
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,369
is grease the pole behind you.

226
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,250
Wow. So Manny's still working.

227
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:40,581
Luke finished
a couple hours ago.

228
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,083
Is that why all these eggs
are on the floor? Oh.

229
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,466
You know, after so many landed safely,
we thought we should test 'em,

230
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:49,889
make sure we weren't working
with a super-strong batch.

231
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,350
Sounds like he knocked it out of the park.
Oh, yeah, definitely.

232
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,972
We did. Um, so, Dad,

233
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:58,102
if I find out what Phil did with that
soldering iron, I'll run it over.

234
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:02,311
Great, 'cause, uh, we're gonna
test it later today at the school.

235
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,612
Fun! Maybe we'll meet you.

236
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,360
Oh, we can come
at any time, right?

237
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,862
'Cause we don't
have a spring problem.

238
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,327
Around 5:00?
Perfect.

239
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,165
Okay. Bear with us.
We're a little rusty.

240
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,335
Yes, and please put
all cell phones on vibrate.

241
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,465
# Don't go breaking my heart #

242
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,669
# I couldn't if I tried #

243
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,093
# Honey, if I get restless #

244
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:35,268
# Baby, you're not that kind 3

245
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,846
# Ooh-hoo #

246
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,602
# Nobody knows it #

247
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,729
# Nobody knows #

248
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,651
# When I was down #

249
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,478
# I was your clown #

250
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:46,859
I really am a clown.

251
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,656
# Ohhh #

252
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:52,076
# I gave you my heart #

253
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,323
# So don't go
breaking my heart #

254
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:58,124
# I won't go
breaking your heart #

255
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,167
#g Don't go breaking my #

256
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,712
# Don't go breaking my heart #)

257
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,959
Yeah, yeah.

258
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,548
Thank you.
Thank you.

259
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,338
It was wonderful.
Oh.

260
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,511
I'm confused, though.
I thought Cameron was the singer.

261
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,551
Yeah.
Oh! Yes. Yes, I am.

262
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,509
Really? Because Mitchell
has such a lovely voice.

263
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,765
Well, I think
he was following my lead.

264
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,562
You know, a good leader
can make all the difference.

265
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,310
Actually, you were a little pitchy.

266
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,858
But it was terrific, really.

267
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:24,900
Thank you.

268
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,978
Yes, thank you for your opinion.

269
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,359
Faster! Faster!

270
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,695
We're going to be late
to your father.

271
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,075
Why did you have to
do your toes too?

272
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:40,705
Well, there's this really cute boy at
school who's kind of into my feet.

273
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,286
Be careful. That can get
really creepy fast.

274
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:48,000
Ay. Where is the car? I park it here.
it's a tow zone.

275
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,585
Somebody just put that there, because
that wasn't here when I parked!

276
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,715
It looks pretty old to me. Haley, don't lie.
That was not here.

277
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,777
Ladies and gentlemen,

278
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,900
get ready
for one of the giants-

279
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,983
of residential real estate.

280
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:16,036
A salesman's salesman.

281
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,283
Where are you guys?
I've been calling you.

282
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,832
A Realtor's Realtor.

283
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,784
You were supposed to do my intro.
Now I have to.

284
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,790
Two-time
nonconsecutive winner ...

285
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,542
of the Realtor of the Year Award-

286
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,089
Just get back here by the end.

287
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,256
Future investors-

288
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,130
Stop making excuses!

289
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:37,057
And start ...
making your dreams come true.

290
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:42,103
Ladies and gentlemen, Phil Dunphy!

291
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,773
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
How are you?

292
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,351
Thanks, Mike. I appreciate it.

293
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,357
Welcome.

294
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,776
Taxi!

295
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,732
You see? They don't stop
because I'm Latina.

296
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:58,070
Or because that was
just a yellow car.

297
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,620
My dad is gonna freak out.

298
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,039
You have to take the blame for this.

299
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:04,250
Why me? Because he'll
never get mad at you.

300
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,918
He totally puts you on a pedestal.

301
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:09,005
That's not true.
Yeah, it is.

302
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,424
Let me just call
the cab company.

303
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,877
Taxi!

304
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,634
It's not rocket science, people.
it's just a little red card.

305
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:21,722
Okay. I guess
nobody needs a mouse pad.

306
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,272
How's my favorite kid doing?

307
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,558
Favorite?

308
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,484
Yeah, I know we're not supposed
to have favorites.

309
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,028
But you know what? We do.

310
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:35,482
And the good news is, it's you.

311
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,488
I'm not giving you my design.

312
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,410
Who said anything about giving?

313
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,950
We can work out an arrangement.
It's cheating.

314
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,657
What do you want? Money?

315
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,367
I got a little somethin' set aside.

316
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,954
Okay, I shouldn't even
be giving you this hint,

317
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,833
but first, get a mirror.
A mirror?

318
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,293
Then you're gonna look in it, and
you're gonna see a crazy woman.

319
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,878
She needs your help.

320
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,925
You know,

321
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:02,384
I made the egg that made you
that made that project,

322
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,811
so in a lot of ways,
that design is already mine!

323
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,190
You're fine.

324
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:14,863
Are you sure that there are ...
no more questions?

325
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,610
No more questions? Yes.

326
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:20,739
If we could just get that over
to the mustachioed gentleman.

327
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,741
Yes, I was-

328
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,743
Oh, hey, I think we're
all tired of that sound.

329
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,371
Let me just come to you.
I bet I know what your question is.

330
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,374
You're probably wondering
if there's a sixth key.

331
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:33,590
No, I was wondering
about a- Come here.

332
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,917
I was wondering
about accelerated escrow.

333
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,879
If it works for both parties,
it's a great way to expedite the deal.

334
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,554
But back to your first question ...

335
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:44,266
about this mysterious sixth key.
I didn't say anything-

336
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,390
The sixth key is the key
to the new home ...

337
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,813
that you purchased below market,

338
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,017
using the simple principles
that you learned here today.

339
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,319
But not so simple
that you don't still need ...

340
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:58,115
the professional services
of Woosnum, Keneally ...

341
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,318
and Dunphy.

342
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,034
Thank you for coming.

343
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,451
Son of a-

344
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,133
So is there anything that
you'd like to know about us?

345
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,177
I don't think so.

346
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,597
In fact, I don't think I need
to interview any more people.

347
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:25,175
You guys are perfect.

348
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,932
Are-Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

349
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,513
Well, I'm not supposed to say
anything to you directly,

350
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,896
but I think you guys
should be expecting good news.

351
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,023
Oh, gosh!

352
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,070
Oh, I know. I know you're
not saying anything, but-

353
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,774
But what you're not saying
is wonderful!

354
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,150
Oh.
All right.

355
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,369
I'm going to get some sparkling cider.
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

356
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,242
It wouldn't be a celebration
without cider ...

357
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,493
or a celebratory song.

358
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,621
But this time,
I want you to sit right here.

359
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:55,376
So have a seat here, and let's just
get this mop out of the way there.

360
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,717
# If you leave me now #

361
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:07,676
# You take away the biggest part of me #

362
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:12,480
# Ooh, no #

363
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:15,274
# Baby, please don't go #

364
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,645
# Ooh, no #

365
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:22,323
# I just want you to stay #

366
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:29,163
Yes, she was upset,
but on a positive note,

367
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:32,242
what I take from this experience is,
I can sing.

368
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,794
But what we didn't take away
from the experience is a baby,

369
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,792
because she decided to keep it.

370
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,424
No. Did we miss everything?

371
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,969
- Yeah. They cleared out of here pretty fast.
- Bummer.

372
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:50,097
More than a bummer, Haley. This was
really important to me, and you blew it.

373
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,725
Ay, no, Phil. It was my fault.
It was not her fault.

374
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,931
Okay. What's done is done.

375
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,187
Can you take the brochures
out to the car?

376
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,893
Wow. Still full.

377
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,819
Yeah, it is.
Oh.

378
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,863
So it was not very good?

379
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,862
Um, no.

380
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,614
I kinda need to sweep here.

381
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,696
Okay. Ay, but I'm so sorry, Phil.

382
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,198
It's okay.
No, it's not okay.

383
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:16,123
We came late, and we ruined your whole
presentation. These things happen.

384
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,421
Yeah, it happens,
and people get angry.

385
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,711
Gloria, it's fine.
No, it's not fine.

386
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,964
I'm trying to have a real conversation,
and all you do is put me on a pedestal!

387
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,011
Wait a minute.
You're mad at me?

388
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:32,469
Yes, because that's not how family
is supposed to treat each other.

389
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,395
You know how family
is supposed to treat each other?

390
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,564
They're supposed to actually
think about each other.

391
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,188
I asked you to do one thing, and you
were too selfish and irresponsible ...

392
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,735
to come through for me
on a day that,

393
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,608
believe it or not,
was really important to me!

394
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,116
Oh, my God. You're crying.
I'm so sorry.

395
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,614
No! That's what I want.

396
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:52,243
You yell at me
because you love me!

397
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,198
Well, you made me mad.

398
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,327
And you should be.
Well, I- I'm not anymore.

399
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,545
Don't treat me like that, Phil.
Because now I'm furious.

400
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,715
¡Ay, mi familia, Phil!

401
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,258
How do you do that?

402
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,549
It makes me so ... mad.

403
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:11,967
That's a pretty nice piece
of handiwork for a 13-year-old.

404
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:15,178
Luke did pretty good too, for a kid that still
needs help gettin' out of his backpack.

405
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,226
Still your grandson.
I felt bad when I said it.

406
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,603
Okay, let's do this. Watch out, kids!
They're comin' down.

407
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,355
One, two, three.

408
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:26,072
How'd we do?

409
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,532
Both eggs are okay.
Great. So we both win.

410
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,827
Unacceptable.
We're goin' up another level.

411
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,495
Absolutely. Come on. Third floor.
Meet us there, Alex. Let's go.

412
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,619
Wait. You don't have to do this.

413
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,076
The assignment was for a one-story drop.
We both get A's.

414
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,706
We're doing this.

415
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,789
I don't like this.

416
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,340
The two of them talking up there-

417
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,631
They're gonna figure out what we did.
We did what we had to.

418
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,257
We're gonna get caught.

419
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:52,432
Look at them down there.
They're not even paying attention.

420
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,133
This is the best part.

421
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,139
Actually, Manny
looks kind of upset.

422
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,596
Why would he be?
He's about to kick Luke's butt.

423
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,478
Oh, knock it off. Luke and Manny had
as much to do with this project ...

424
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,810
as they did
with the Manhattan Project.

425
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,520
You think
that's what's going on?

426
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,273
They're upset because we
took over for them? Maybe.

427
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:12,577
They were supposed to learn from
this, and-and we ruined it.

428
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,536
We should go talk to them.
Yeah.

429
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,125
Boys, we need to talk.

430
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,086
Oh, God. Oh, God. Just stay frosty.

431
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,585
So, uh, we realized
a couple things up there,

432
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,167
and I think apologies
are in order.

433
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,047
Okay, we admit it.

434
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,345
We tricked you into
doing our projects for us.

435
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,797
What?

436
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,632
This is the first
I'm hearing of this.

437
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:38,185
We knew you'd do all the work if you thought
you were competing with each other.

438
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,139
So I told you I thought Claire was helping
Luke, and then you called Claire-

439
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:42,690
Which got me involved, and-

440
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,358
All right.
Here's what's gonna happen.

441
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,527
You're gonna get in the car,
we're gonna drive home ...

442
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,193
and you're each gonna do
your own projects. Mm-hmm.

443
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,361
Fine.
Okay.

444
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,909
Hmm. Hmm.

445
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,237
This is your fault.

446
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,286
What? The way we compete
with each other, it's sick.

447
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,084
It's so sick, two 13-year-olds
know how to take advantage of us.

448
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,787
And you know what?
You made me this way.

449
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,335
How do you figure that?
Oh, Dad!

450
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,258
You pushed me into sports.
You never let me win.

451
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,756
You know, that's a-
it does something to a girl.

452
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:14,510
For your information,
you came out of the womb like that.

453
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,341
I'm not entirely sure there wasn't
a twin in there you bumped off.

454
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:20,645
If you saw that in me,
why didn't you discourage it?

455
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,848
Why would I discourage
something that I love?

456
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:26,146
Really?
You kidding?

457
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,727
You're a fighter.

458
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,359
The thing I love about you
is that you never give up.

459
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,529
Dad.

460
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,781
Even though I clearly designed
a superior egg container.

461
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,363
Out of your mind, old man.

462
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:40,119
Only one way to find out.

463
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,295
Give up. You're all
just playing for second.

464
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,008
There's somethin' wrong
with that one.

465
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:57,139
I'm not wrong.
Mom can be crazy, right?

466
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,431
Hello!

467
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,101
Thank you.

468
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:04,306
But at the same time, I feel
guilty when I get mad at her.

469
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,516
I don't think that's weird.

470
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,102
I'm just really proud of my project,
and I didn't want to share it.

471
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:11,028
Everybody has their own thing.

472
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,776
Thanks, Haley.

473
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:14,448
I know it might sound dorky,

474
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:17,072
but these late-night conversations
really mean a lot to me.

475
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:19,279
They're the only time
that I feel like you and I are-

476
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,659
Okay, Corey,
just one picture.

477
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,616
Hold on.

478
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,248
My feet look
fat from this angle.

479
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,295
Hey, Alex, wake up.

480
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,418
I need you to take
a picture of my feet.

481
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:37,797
English - US - PSDH
