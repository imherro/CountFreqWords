1
00:00:05,257 --> 00:00:09,344
Come on, boys!
it's Leap Day, not Sleep Day!

2
00:00:09,428 --> 00:00:11,221
Whoo!

3
00:00:11,305 --> 00:00:13,599
I love Leap Day!

4
00:00:13,682 --> 00:00:15,809
it's kind of a
big deal in the Dunphy house.

5
00:00:15,893 --> 00:00:17,436
This year, we even
got Manny involved.

6
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:19,897
You're given this gift
of 24 extra hours.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,899
You can't waste it
at work or school.

8
00:00:21,982 --> 00:00:24,776
You have to do something
extraordinary, something shocking.

9
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,072
Mmm. This year, the entire family
is taking a trapeze class.

10
00:00:29,198 --> 00:00:31,366
How extraordinary is that?
It was my idea.

11
00:00:31,491 --> 00:00:34,536
How shocking is that? I can be
spontaneous every four years.

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,913
I can't wait.

13
00:00:35,996 --> 00:00:37,915
Leap Day is stupid.

14
00:00:37,998 --> 00:00:39,791
You're not understanding
the logic behind it.

15
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:44,087
A year is actually 365.25 days.

16
00:00:44,171 --> 00:00:46,256
Every four years,
we gain one day.

17
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,800
If we didn't adjust
the calendar, in, say, 40 years,

18
00:00:48,884 --> 00:00:51,220
February would almost be January.

19
00:00:51,303 --> 00:00:55,390
That's not my problem.
And it's definitely not your problem.

20
00:00:55,474 --> 00:00:59,102
Look at this. The housekeeper turned
another one of my whites pink.

21
00:00:59,186 --> 00:01:00,938
I can't wear this
to a sports bar.

22
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:03,106
They're not going
to be looking at you, Jay.

23
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:04,775
Somebody's feeling
pretty good about herself.

24
00:01:04,858 --> 00:01:06,568
They're going to be
watching the match.

25
00:01:06,652 --> 00:01:09,154
You meant you a little bit.

26
00:01:10,447 --> 00:01:11,865
Okay, put it in there.

27
00:01:11,949 --> 00:01:14,993
All right. Very quietly, we're
gonna go to Daddy's bedroom,

28
00:01:15,077 --> 00:01:16,703
open the door and-

29
00:01:19,373 --> 00:01:20,958
Happy birthday to me.

30
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:23,710
I'm 10!
Forty!

31
00:01:23,794 --> 00:01:25,254
I was born February 29,

32
00:01:25,337 --> 00:01:27,464
and there have been
10 of those in my lifetime,

33
00:01:27,547 --> 00:01:29,466
therefore I'm 10!

34
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:30,550
It's fun.

35
00:01:30,634 --> 00:01:32,219
It's so much fun.

36
00:01:32,302 --> 00:01:34,346
Anyway, I've spent
the last four years...

37
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:36,765
trying to figure out what kind
of party to throw this one.

38
00:01:36,848 --> 00:01:38,433
Honey, you know
I'd be fine with just...

39
00:01:38,517 --> 00:01:40,269
a nice casual evening
at home with you.

40
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,728
Don't- Don't even.

41
00:01:41,812 --> 00:01:44,064
No, no. That's what
he said last time.

42
00:01:45,232 --> 00:01:47,776
Okay, birthday boy.
What's it gonna be?

43
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:49,444
Rom-com or horror?

44
00:01:49,528 --> 00:01:51,405
Or we could do both
and watch Maid in Manhattan.

45
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,115
What you doing?

46
00:01:53,198 --> 00:01:55,033
Canceling our baby.

47
00:01:56,702 --> 00:01:58,578
# Hey, hey #

48
00:01:58,662 --> 00:02:00,622
# Hey, hey #

49
00:02:00,706 --> 00:02:02,624
# Hey, hey #

50
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:04,626
# Hey, hey #

51
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,877
# Hey ##

52
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:11,049
Okay, love to Dad. Bye.

53
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:15,512
Daddy, what are you doing? Oh.

54
00:02:15,595 --> 00:02:17,556
- Yeah, Daddy, what are you doing?
- I was-

55
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,474
Snooping for hints
about your birthday?

56
00:02:19,558 --> 00:02:21,518
Wow. Get.

57
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:24,021
No, I'm just excited,
and I want to be helpful.

58
00:02:24,104 --> 00:02:25,939
I know party planning
isn't your thing.

59
00:02:26,023 --> 00:02:27,316
Wow.

60
00:02:27,399 --> 00:02:29,192
You need to trust me, Cam.

61
00:02:29,276 --> 00:02:30,986
I know. And I do.

62
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:32,904
It's not like you're gonna do
anything tired,

63
00:02:32,988 --> 00:02:34,698
like appletinis
or ice sculptures.

64
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:36,325
Or synthetic napkins
or anything Mylar.

65
00:02:36,408 --> 00:02:37,617
Cam, that's enough.

66
00:02:37,701 --> 00:02:39,786
I've been paying for your
last party for four years.

67
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,496
And I find it a little insulting...

68
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,206
that you don't think
I could pull this off.

69
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,042
You know what?

70
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,877
I trust you. I'm letting go.

71
00:02:47,002 --> 00:02:48,962
Okay? Okay-

72
00:02:49,046 --> 00:02:52,007
- You know orange is over, right?
- it's a simple party. I can do it.

73
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,884
Simple.

74
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:55,761
Perfect.

75
00:02:55,844 --> 00:02:57,971
Yeah, just a simple party.

76
00:02:58,055 --> 00:03:00,057
I'm simply taking Cam's favorite
movie,

77
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,641
The Wizard of Oz,

78
00:03:01,725 --> 00:03:04,561
and turning our house
into an Oz-themed extravaganza.

79
00:03:04,644 --> 00:03:06,188
Yellow brick carpet,

80
00:03:06,271 --> 00:03:08,023
waitstaff in full costume...

81
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:10,275
and custom-made
ruby slippers for Cam.

82
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:11,818
Whassup?

83
00:03:11,943 --> 00:03:14,613
So is this safe?
it's a trapeze.

84
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:19,034
Relax. More people are killed by
knife-wielding strangers than from trapezing.

85
00:03:19,117 --> 00:03:21,036
I'm thinking about
going home now.

86
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:25,374
# In the arms of the angels #

87
00:03:25,457 --> 00:03:27,501
These animals
need your help.

88
00:03:27,584 --> 00:03:29,294
Honey, are you okay?

89
00:03:29,378 --> 00:03:30,712
I'm fine.

90
00:03:30,796 --> 00:03:33,673
I'm fine. Just-
So sad.

91
00:03:36,051 --> 00:03:38,053
Oh, no. Not today.

92
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:39,930
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

93
00:03:40,013 --> 00:03:42,391
No, your mom's
just, uh, feeling emotional.

94
00:03:42,474 --> 00:03:44,267
She was like this
last month.

95
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:46,478
And the month before.
And the month before.

96
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:50,065
What? I could kill someone!
No, I can't hear you!

97
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:53,318
This stupid phone gets no reception
in this stupid house!

98
00:03:55,404 --> 00:03:56,905
Dear God, no.

99
00:03:56,988 --> 00:03:58,907
I heard rumors. Yeah.

100
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,742
We all had.

101
00:04:00,826 --> 00:04:02,911
That females living or working
in close quarters...

102
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:05,747
could eventually
get on the same cycle.

103
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:10,001
But I always assumed that was a story designed
to keep women out of the submarine corps.

104
00:04:12,462 --> 00:04:16,007
This isn't milk. What's wrong with me today?
My brain's not working right.

105
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:18,635
No!  I can't foc-

106
00:04:18,718 --> 00:04:20,303
Won't you help ?

107
00:04:20,387 --> 00:04:21,972
Three legs?

108
00:04:22,055 --> 00:04:23,098
It's not fair!

109
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:25,892
I know. it's so sad.

110
00:04:25,976 --> 00:04:28,103
Oh, my God.
They're gonna ruin everything.

111
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:30,564
No,no,no. We-We just need
to be extra sensitive.

112
00:04:30,647 --> 00:04:32,649
Phil, honey,
when do we need to leave?

113
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:34,734
Whenever's good for you, sweetie.
Maybe 20 minutes?

114
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,361
Twenty minutes? Well,
which one is it, Phil?

115
00:04:36,486 --> 00:04:39,739
Whenever is
good for me, or is it 20 minutes?

116
00:04:39,823 --> 00:04:41,366
Whenever you're ready.

117
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:44,578
It happened.
Satan's trifecta.

118
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:47,539
The day I most dreaded had
fallen on the day I most loved.

119
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,794
They're gonna ruin trapezing.

120
00:04:52,878 --> 00:04:54,629
I bet they don't
even catch me.

121
00:04:54,713 --> 00:04:56,965
Why are you so afraid of them?
They're reasonable.

122
00:04:57,048 --> 00:04:59,885
Why don't we just suggest they stay home,
considering they're all on their mens-

123
00:04:59,968 --> 00:05:02,387
Shh! The first rule of
dealing with the cycle:

124
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:04,055
You never mention the cycle.

125
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,308
You tiptoe around it.

126
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:10,395
The woman's actually taking great pains
to hide the monster she's become.

127
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,565
But if you acknowledge it,
that brings the monster forth.

128
00:05:13,648 --> 00:05:16,693
My God.
And there's three of them.

129
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:19,738
It's okay. I have a plan.

130
00:05:20,906 --> 00:05:23,492
It's kind of traditional
for people to lean in...

131
00:05:23,575 --> 00:05:25,535
when somebody says
“I have a plan.”

132
00:05:26,745 --> 00:05:27,704
Okay-

133
00:05:27,787 --> 00:05:30,457
Ja! Ja! Ja! Ja!

134
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,292
Ja, ja, ja, ja, ja, ja, ja, ja!

135
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:35,587
No! No!
Sí! Sí! Sí! Sí! Sí!

136
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:40,342
Go! Go!

137
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:42,886
You should call your country the
Never-lands because you never-

138
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:46,139
Ja, because we are never going to win.
You said that a billion times.

139
00:05:46,223 --> 00:05:47,682
Just go home.

140
00:05:47,766 --> 00:05:49,851
Why don't you
Dutch people go home?

141
00:05:49,935 --> 00:05:52,103
Someone should shut
your Colombian mouth.

142
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:54,648
Okay, I want to see you try.
ls there a problem over here?

143
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:56,816
Yes, there is a problem,
and you are married to her.

144
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,570
Really? Well,
let me make a suggestion.

145
00:06:00,654 --> 00:06:03,990
Why don't you sit down, I send you over a
beer, my wife and I watch from over there.

146
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:05,992
That way,
everybody enjoys the game.

147
00:06:06,076 --> 00:06:09,162
Except me, 'cause I prefer
a game where something happens.

148
00:06:09,246 --> 00:06:11,122
Gloria, let's go.

149
00:06:14,668 --> 00:06:17,128
I thought you were going to
punch that guy back there.

150
00:06:17,212 --> 00:06:19,047
Ah, I got 60 pounds
on the kid.

151
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:23,051
Yeah. it's just that I'd heard so
many stories about you fighting.

152
00:06:23,176 --> 00:06:26,972
It's just not worth the trouble.
Yeah, and he has all those friends.

153
00:06:27,055 --> 00:06:28,890
Well, his friends
had nothing to do with it.

154
00:06:28,974 --> 00:06:30,725
Just sometimes it's better
to take the high road.

155
00:06:30,809 --> 00:06:32,978
Yeah, it's better
that you walked away.

156
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:36,773
Gloria, I get- I get the impression you're
disappointed I didn't punch that guy.

157
00:06:36,856 --> 00:06:41,403
Of course not. Who needs all that
manly “protect your woman” stuff?

158
00:06:41,486 --> 00:06:43,405
No, see, like right there.
You're saying one thing,

159
00:06:43,488 --> 00:06:45,156
but it feels like
you mean the opposite.

160
00:06:45,282 --> 00:06:47,117
No.
That's a yes.

161
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,494
Look, Jay. I just came
to watch the game.

162
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:51,371
I don't want to fight.
Neither do I.

163
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:54,749
I know.

164
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,459
So, in keeping
with the film,

165
00:06:56,543 --> 00:07:01,214
this area will be in black and white,
and then an explosion of Technicolor.

166
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:03,842
Best part, as
the guests are coming in-

167
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:05,719
“Auntie Em! Auntie Em!”

168
00:07:05,802 --> 00:07:07,721
A simulated tornado.

169
00:07:07,804 --> 00:07:09,472
Yeah.
Oh, he's gonna love that.

170
00:07:09,556 --> 00:07:11,641
So the
appletinis are canceled-

171
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:13,810
Yes. the little Toto
dog is ordered, and-

172
00:07:13,893 --> 00:07:16,313
Please tell me that you are
not mixing punch in costume.

173
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:21,401
Oh, no.
What is Cam doing home?

174
00:07:22,527 --> 00:07:23,695
Hey-
Hey-

175
00:07:23,778 --> 00:07:25,614
- We're the monkeys.
- Yes, hi. Come on inside.

176
00:07:25,697 --> 00:07:27,616
Quickly, quickly. Hi.

177
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:29,451
Okay, one second.

178
00:07:29,534 --> 00:07:32,370
Hey. What you doing home? Are you
checking on me and the party again?

179
00:07:32,454 --> 00:07:35,624
No, no. I left my cell phone in your car,
and I gotta be in touch with Mama today.

180
00:07:35,707 --> 00:07:37,626
She's talking to the insurance
agency for the first time...

181
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:39,502
to see if they're gonna
rebuild Grandpa's farm.

182
00:07:39,586 --> 00:07:41,504
Rebuild the-

183
00:07:41,588 --> 00:07:43,298
Because of the tornado.

184
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:45,133
I totally
missed the connection.

185
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:49,137
A month after the most devastating
twister to ever hit Cam's hometown,

186
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:54,768
I throw a party based on gay
cinema's most famous tornado.

187
00:07:54,851 --> 00:07:57,062
Yeah. You know,
it's been a month,

188
00:07:57,145 --> 00:07:59,773
and she hasn't heard anything,
and she's just beside herself.

189
00:07:59,856 --> 00:08:02,734
And then- You know what else?
Lily succumbed to her injuries.

190
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:04,861
- Your Aunt Lily died?
- No, the family pig.

191
00:08:04,944 --> 00:08:07,947
Aunt Lily was a-
We named our daughter after a pig?

192
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:10,283
Can you just witness my pain
instead of criticizing?

193
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:12,452
I just want to be in touch
with my family today.

194
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:14,663
Get all this tornado stuff
behind me...

195
00:08:14,746 --> 00:08:18,166
so I can enjoy the fabulous
party you're planning for me.

196
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:20,293
Yeah. Gotta get outta here.

197
00:08:20,377 --> 00:08:24,297
Okay. Hey, listen. Hey, Cam, you just
call your family, tell them I said hi.

198
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:27,676
And don't worry about being back at 6:00 on the dot.
There's a little breathing room.

199
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,636
Oh, what, are you kidding me?

200
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:32,472
The sooner I can start to party,
the sooner I can start to forget.

201
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:34,808
But then again,
hey, if you keep running from...

202
00:08:34,891 --> 00:08:37,811
every reminder of the tornado,
doesn't the tornado win?

203
00:08:37,894 --> 00:08:39,938
Mitchell, my grandpa runs to his
pickup truck every morning...

204
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:42,315
because he thinks the pitchfork
is gonna come back down.

205
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,609
The tornado always wins.
Yeah.

206
00:08:44,693 --> 00:08:47,445
Okay. Well, it's
gonna be so much fun tonight!

207
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:50,240
- I know. The big 1-0!
- 4-0!

208
00:08:50,365 --> 00:08:52,742
Hey, Mitchell!
I'm over here.

209
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:54,369
I could've hit you. But you didn't.

210
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:55,912
I'm doing
my “I Love You” dance.

211
00:08:55,995 --> 00:08:57,831
Okay. I'm doing
my “I Love You” car dance.

212
00:08:57,956 --> 00:08:59,541
Look at me.
Look at you.

213
00:08:59,624 --> 00:09:00,875
Stop that.
Fish move!

214
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,419
Okay, go!

215
00:09:02,544 --> 00:09:04,212
This is dangerous. Go.
Okay, okay.

216
00:09:04,337 --> 00:09:06,506
Get out of here, you.
it's my birthday!

217
00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:09,592
All right, guys. Come here.

218
00:09:09,676 --> 00:09:11,886
We need to talk.

219
00:09:13,638 --> 00:09:16,099
There they are.
Stop rushing us!

220
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:18,184
Buddy, what's wrong?

221
00:09:18,268 --> 00:09:20,895
Yes, you've been
a little off all morning.

222
00:09:20,979 --> 00:09:23,189
I've been feeling
a lot of stress lately.

223
00:09:23,273 --> 00:09:25,567
My head's all foggy,
and I'm kind of emotional.

224
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,861
Oh. Well, I sure hope
you feel better soon,

225
00:09:27,944 --> 00:09:31,030
'cause you really need your wits
about you when you're trapezing.

226
00:09:31,114 --> 00:09:35,869
This is weird, because the three of us haven't
exactly been feeling our best today either.

227
00:09:35,994 --> 00:09:38,329
Really?  Can't
find my other sock!

228
00:09:38,413 --> 00:09:40,957
- Try looking under the one you have on.
- I am not you.

229
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,752
I don't do that. See?

230
00:09:43,835 --> 00:09:45,336
God, I am you.

231
00:09:46,671 --> 00:09:49,174
- Would you mind if we sat out trapezing?
- Really?

232
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:51,342
Yeah. Are you sure?
Okay.

233
00:09:51,426 --> 00:09:53,678
Why does he do that?
Every month.

234
00:09:53,762 --> 00:09:55,847
Yeah, I get a little moody,

235
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:59,476
but unrelenting physical discomfort
will do that to a person.

236
00:09:59,601 --> 00:10:03,980
Doesn't he know that tiptoeing around someone
like they're crazy makes them crazy?

237
00:10:04,063 --> 00:10:06,733
All right. You and Manny go ahead.
Luke can just stay here with us.

238
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:09,152
- Wait. What?
- Luke's actually looking better.

239
00:10:09,277 --> 00:10:11,488
I am better. Well, let's
not take any chances.

240
00:10:11,613 --> 00:10:13,740
He can stay here. You go ahead.
Dad?

241
00:10:13,823 --> 00:10:15,617
- Um, I-
- Daddy?

242
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,661
- See you later, buddy.
- What are we going to do?

243
00:10:18,745 --> 00:10:20,580
We leave no man behind.

244
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:23,625
I think I'm just
gonna go home.

245
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:27,045
We have time. Just take down the
decorations and have a normal party.

246
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:28,880
And throw a boring party
in our house...

247
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:30,882
that looks like I just threw
it together this afternoon?

248
00:10:31,007 --> 00:10:32,592
Think!
Okay, we have a few options.

249
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:34,636
I can get you
the back room at Amelia's.

250
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:37,305
Spilled juice on the owner's white rug
and almost killed her toddler. Next.

251
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,932
Bowling alley?
Not classy enough.

252
00:10:39,057 --> 00:10:40,517
What have you got?
Uh-

253
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,436
You're no help. You. Well, last
weekend I did a party on a boat.

254
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,897
- You said you were visiting your parents.
- You're suffocating me.

255
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,649
What's this boat?
Tell me about the boat.

256
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:51,194
Okay, we did an elegant dinner party
on a luxury yacht for about 25 people.

257
00:10:51,277 --> 00:10:53,655
It takes you around the harbor,
dancing under the moonlight.

258
00:10:53,738 --> 00:10:56,616
Okay. Okay. Maybe we can
make a theme out of this.

259
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:58,660
Cam's life is like a long voyage.

260
00:10:58,743 --> 00:11:01,579
Sometimes choppy, but always
forward- ever forward.

261
00:11:01,663 --> 00:11:03,706
- We have two hours.
- Book it.

262
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,877
Hey. You survived
trapeze class, huh?

263
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:11,798
Didn't happen. And common decency
prevents me from telling you why.

264
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:13,675
- How was the soccer match?
- Thrilling.

265
00:11:13,758 --> 00:11:16,177
1-1 tie. One of the goals
was an accident.

266
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:18,012
I'm sure my mom
was happy you went.

267
00:11:18,096 --> 00:11:21,099
I don't know what to make of her today.
She got into it with this guy,

268
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:23,643
and I swear she was pushing me
into a fight with him.

269
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:26,062
Now, is that something she'd want?
I don't know.

270
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:28,565
I always thought of women
as the more evolved sex.

271
00:11:28,648 --> 00:11:30,567
But after today-
I've seen things, Jay.

272
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:33,278
As you know, I had my share of
fights in my time. You know that.

273
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:37,532
Mmm, it's-
it's too warm for me.

274
00:11:37,615 --> 00:11:40,034
I remember this time I was
crossing the street with Dede,

275
00:11:40,118 --> 00:11:42,203
and some jackass
almost clipped her.

276
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:45,832
I had the guy on the ground, my foot on
his neck, before the car stopped moving.

277
00:11:45,915 --> 00:11:47,458
Yeah, we've heard
all the stories.

278
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:50,420
Maybe my mom wouldn't mind
a glimpse of that Jay.

279
00:11:50,503 --> 00:11:54,215
That's her. She wants me to help pick out Cam's gift.

280
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:56,551
I'm still that guy,
you know. 100%.

281
00:11:56,634 --> 00:11:59,053
What the hell? How do you cut
your finger on a cracker?

282
00:11:59,137 --> 00:12:01,723
Anyway, if I thought there was a
fight worth fighting, I'd fight it.

283
00:12:01,806 --> 00:12:04,392
Ow! Now I got salt in this.
That stings!

284
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,649
Next time, don't scream at your boss...

285
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:13,735
so that he doesn't make you
work during the weekends.

286
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:16,613
Y pueda venir a ver
a tu hijo, por favor.

287
00:12:16,696 --> 00:12:18,740
Sí. Adíos.

288
00:12:18,823 --> 00:12:20,867
Hey, Mom.
Who were you yelling at?

289
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:25,204
Your father, baby.
He cannot make it this weekend.

290
00:12:27,332 --> 00:12:29,250
Okay, I admit it.

291
00:12:29,334 --> 00:12:33,254
I wanted Jay to kick that little
Dutchman's ass at the bar.

292
00:12:33,338 --> 00:12:35,590
But two seconds
on the phone with Javier,

293
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:39,719
and I remember what that stupid
hothead behavior gets you.

294
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:43,431
Nothing. it's better
to be calm, like Jay.

295
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:45,183
Like Jay and me.

296
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:47,477
Like Jay.

297
00:12:49,604 --> 00:12:53,566
I'm back! Wouldn't you know, I
forgot my ding-dang sunglasses.

298
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:54,609
Oh.

299
00:12:54,692 --> 00:12:57,528
Huh. Luke,
could you give me a hand?

300
00:12:57,612 --> 00:12:59,906
What were the chances
that Phil had come back...

301
00:12:59,989 --> 00:13:02,116
to apologize
for all the game-playing...

302
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,453
and have an open conversation
with me about what I was feeling?

303
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:08,957
Okay, I got a bottle of fake blood
out of the Halloween supplies.

304
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,084
Put a dab on your finger,
say you cut it,

305
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:13,544
I say I need to run you by
the doctor, easy trapezey.

306
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,339
Got it? See you on the
other side, brother.

307
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:20,385
Just once, I would like Phil
to have a little empathy.

308
00:13:20,468 --> 00:13:24,722
Give me some sense that he
understands what women go through.

309
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:26,933
You feelin' any better?

310
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:28,935
Hate to see
the whole team on the D.L.

311
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:32,772
- Ow! My finger!
- I don't like the sound of that.

312
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:39,654
- I said a little bit.
- The cap fell off. I decided just to go with it.

313
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:42,490
Okay, we gotta get you out
the back-

314
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:44,701
- What happened?
- Oh, it's just a little cut.

315
00:13:44,784 --> 00:13:46,703
But to be safe,
I'll run him by the doctor.

316
00:13:46,786 --> 00:13:48,705
No! Are you crazy?
Call 911!

317
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,957
Oh, no, they're so busy.
Where's the wound?

318
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,376
- We need to put pressure on it, right?
- I'm gonna be sick!

319
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:55,503
Oh, he needs a tourniquet!
Where do I put it?

320
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:57,714
Stop. There is nothing
wrong with him.

321
00:13:57,797 --> 00:13:59,799
- Luke, what's going on?
- I cut my finger.

322
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,301
- Dad?
- How crazy is that?

323
00:14:02,385 --> 00:14:04,387
They were in my pocket the whole time.
I'll see you.

324
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:07,140
Phil!
What is going on, Luke?

325
00:14:07,223 --> 00:14:10,435
Dad staged the whole thing so we could
go on the trapeze without you three.

326
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:14,647
- Why?
- Because- Because-

327
00:14:14,731 --> 00:14:17,567
You're all monsterating!

328
00:14:17,692 --> 00:14:19,569
Luke, no!
Are you kidding me?

329
00:14:19,652 --> 00:14:21,154
Oh, my God!
I'm sorry.

330
00:14:21,237 --> 00:14:23,740
I know you told me not to
say it, but-  Phil.

331
00:14:23,823 --> 00:14:25,742
Is this what you've been
teaching our son?

332
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:28,077
That women are some kind of
unclean lepers...

333
00:14:28,161 --> 00:14:30,288
that should be hidden away
under sheets for a week?

334
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:33,708
- Do you have any idea how offensive that is?
- I do, honey.

335
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:37,503
And from the bottom
of my heart, I am so...

336
00:14:37,587 --> 00:14:39,088
scared.

337
00:14:40,048 --> 00:14:42,091
Oh, no!

338
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,302
Oh, my.

339
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:52,727
Okay. Three, two, one!

340
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,479
Surprise!

341
00:14:54,604 --> 00:14:57,023
Oh, my gosh! Oh, it's amazing!
Yeah, it's a boat party!

342
00:14:57,148 --> 00:14:59,275
Oh. Because?
Your life is like a voyage.

343
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:00,943
Oh. Well, everyone's is,

344
00:15:01,027 --> 00:15:03,696
but I love it because none of our
other friends have ever done it.

345
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,739
Oh.

346
00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:06,824
Oh, that's so sweet.

347
00:15:06,908 --> 00:15:10,119
It must be easy with no dirty,
broken woman in the relationship.

348
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:14,165
What are you laughing at?

349
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:17,043
Okay. Everybody follow
the birthday flag.

350
00:15:17,126 --> 00:15:19,087
What'd you call me?
Oh, the- Uh, yes.

351
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,964
Oh, my gosh. it's so elegant.
Pepper must be dying.

352
00:15:22,048 --> 00:15:24,550
Oh, you know, actually, Pepper
couldn't come because he hates boats.

353
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:27,053
You know, after the navy, so- Oh.
Oh, yeah.

354
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:30,139
Oh, I guess Longines
got over his fear of water.

355
00:15:30,223 --> 00:15:34,310
No, no. Why don't we just focus on the 30
people who are here having a great time?

356
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:37,230
Eee! Smells like
somebody's dead.

357
00:15:37,313 --> 00:15:39,023
What is that smell?

358
00:15:39,107 --> 00:15:41,692
That faint odor is-
is a tiny, tiny blue whale,

359
00:15:41,776 --> 00:15:44,487
who apparently has indeed died,
uh, nearby.

360
00:15:44,612 --> 00:15:47,865
But- Yeah, but it's
getting all over my coat.

361
00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:51,744
I don't smell anything. Maybe that's because
you smell like a bouquet of flower-

362
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:53,663
Ow!
Oh, yeah.

363
00:15:53,746 --> 00:15:55,373
Watch out for that.

364
00:15:55,498 --> 00:15:59,252
It smells like puke married
poop and had the ceremony in my nose.

365
00:15:59,377 --> 00:16:01,963
You paint with words.
Okay. Don't worry, everybody.

366
00:16:02,046 --> 00:16:05,133
Soon we'll be way, way out at
sea, bouncing on the waves...

367
00:16:05,216 --> 00:16:07,426
with all of his sweet-smelling
brothers and sisters, okay?

368
00:16:07,552 --> 00:16:09,095
Mitchell Pritchett?
Oh, yes. Hi.

369
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:11,013
Hi. I'm your captain tonight.
We've got a problem.

370
00:16:11,097 --> 00:16:12,849
I can't fit
this many people on my boat.

371
00:16:12,932 --> 00:16:15,685
No, no. I was told you could take 30.
I have exactly 30 guests.

372
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:18,479
Plus six in help.
You gotta drop a few people.

373
00:16:18,563 --> 00:16:20,773
Come on. There must be
something that we can do here.

374
00:16:20,857 --> 00:16:24,110
Well, we have bigger boats, but this is
the best I could do on two hours' notice.

375
00:16:24,235 --> 00:16:25,903
Uh-
What is the problem?

376
00:16:25,987 --> 00:16:28,656
Apparently Mitchell started planning
my birthday party two hours ago.

377
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:30,825
Mm-mmm.
No, no. I-I-I did not.

378
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:34,328
Uh, apparently we have too
many people for his boat, so-

379
00:16:34,412 --> 00:16:38,040
That's crazy. I've seen more people
clinging to a floating door.

380
00:16:38,124 --> 00:16:39,750
I'm sorry, lady.
it's a safety issue.

381
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:42,003
Oh, no, you're going to have
a safety issue...

382
00:16:42,086 --> 00:16:44,255
if you don't take me away
from this whale.

383
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:47,175
- Okay, a little too much finger, a little
too much attitude. -What's all this?

384
00:16:47,258 --> 00:16:49,635
Two hours of Mitchell's
hard work going down the drain.

385
00:16:49,719 --> 00:16:52,722
Look, I can't fit
more than 30 people on the boat,

386
00:16:52,805 --> 00:16:54,682
as I was just explaining
to the lady here.

387
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:56,642
Well, first of all,
that lady is my son.

388
00:16:56,726 --> 00:16:59,562
- He wasn't- He wasn't talking about me.
- I was talking about her.

389
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:03,065
Oh, her. Oh, it's “her” now.
Well, “her” happens to be my wife.

390
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:05,526
You got a problem with her,
you got a problem with me.

391
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,695
No, no, Jay, calm down.

392
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:10,031
I didn't have a problem before,
but now I'm starting to.

393
00:17:10,114 --> 00:17:12,074
No, your problem is about
to get a lot bigger.

394
00:17:12,158 --> 00:17:14,785
No, Jay. I know you think this
is what I want, but it's not.

395
00:17:14,911 --> 00:17:18,497
I got this, Gloria. No, Jay, I
was just being stupid today.

396
00:17:18,581 --> 00:17:22,501
I like that you're calm, that you
think first and you act second.

397
00:17:22,585 --> 00:17:24,337
I need that in my life.

398
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,963
Yeah.
So walk away, Grandpa.

399
00:17:26,047 --> 00:17:27,173
You know what-

400
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:29,717
Nobody calls him Grandpa!

401
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,386
I do.
Okay, that's it.

402
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,348
No boat. Everybody off my dock,
or I'm calling the cops.

403
00:17:35,473 --> 00:17:37,725
Wait, wait. So no party now?
No, no, of course.

404
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:39,685
Just- Just give me
a minute, okay?

405
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:43,147
Well, after what you did with two hours, I
can't wait to see what you do with a minute.

406
00:17:43,231 --> 00:17:44,732
Cam-

407
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:47,068
Poor Cam.
He seems so upset.

408
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:50,154
Oh, is that hard for you, Phil? That
he's having a feeling around you?

409
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:51,948
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Too many emotions?

410
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:53,991
Okay, okay, I give up!

411
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:56,786
Yeah, I made a mistake today.

412
00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:59,080
But only because the three
of you ganged up on me,

413
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:02,750
like when the Wolf Man, Dracula and
Frankenstein show up in the same movie,

414
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,378
except this wasn't awesome!

415
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:08,464
I have been on an emotional
roller coaster all day today.

416
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:10,508
I'm afraid. I'm mad.
I'm mad because I'm afraid.

417
00:18:10,633 --> 00:18:14,220
Now I can't even think straight because I'm in
so much pain from what just happened over there.

418
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:16,973
And the whole thing makes me so
sad, and I'm not even sure why,

419
00:18:17,056 --> 00:18:19,725
and I'm nauseous from that smell,
but I'm so hungry.

420
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,814
Yeah.

421
00:18:26,065 --> 00:18:28,609
Cam, the-the boat wasn't
even part of the plan.

422
00:18:28,693 --> 00:18:31,862
No, it's fine. it's my fault for
letting my expectations get too high.

423
00:18:31,946 --> 00:18:33,698
I'll get over this one too.

424
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:36,367
No, no, I had this whole
Wizard of Oz party planned,

425
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,870
only today I realized that it
might be a little too tornado-y.

426
00:18:39,996 --> 00:18:41,580
Today?
Yes. I'm sorry.

427
00:18:41,664 --> 00:18:43,207
I didn't make
the connection, okay?

428
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,293
Probably 'cause I've been
planning for months...

429
00:18:45,376 --> 00:18:47,670
so that you could have the
perfect party and be happy,

430
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:49,547
which now I don't even
think is possible.

431
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:53,384
Oh, I'm sorry that I would like to
have a nice 10th birthday party.

432
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:57,888
Well, you can't have it, Cam. You
want to know why? Because you're 40!

433
00:18:57,972 --> 00:19:00,224
You're a 40-year-old man!

434
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,895
I am 40.

435
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:09,358
I'm 40.
Yes.

436
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:13,154
Okay, stop it.

437
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:15,614
I'm 40,
and I'm on this stupid-

438
00:19:15,698 --> 00:19:19,201
Wait, what is that?
What is this... thing?

439
00:19:19,285 --> 00:19:23,914
Suddenly it all made sense. Cam's
craziness all day wasn't about a party.

440
00:19:23,998 --> 00:19:27,668
It was about turning 40.
And once he realized that,

441
00:19:27,752 --> 00:19:29,712
everything got much worse.

442
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:31,839
I've done nothing
with my life!

443
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:34,508
What? Stop it. Come on.
How can you say that?

444
00:19:34,592 --> 00:19:39,221
You're a wonderful father. You-
You graduated from clown college.

445
00:19:39,305 --> 00:19:41,098
You've been to France.

446
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:44,352
I don't want to be 40. it's not fair.
I know.

447
00:19:44,435 --> 00:19:46,228
Nothing's fair.

448
00:19:46,354 --> 00:19:51,609
Two miles from here is an amusement park full
of happy families swinging on a trapeze.

449
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:54,528
That's all I wanted
for my special bonus day.

450
00:19:57,907 --> 00:19:59,742
What?

451
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:02,787
I'd been trying so hard to figure out
what Cam wanted for his birthday.

452
00:20:03,788 --> 00:20:06,207
He'd been telling me all along.

453
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,125
He wanted to be 10.

454
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:10,669
Whoo!

455
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,465
Whoo!

456
00:20:18,386 --> 00:20:20,513
Seriously?
There's nothing you can do?

457
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:22,431
I'm sorry.
You just missed the cutoff.

458
00:20:22,515 --> 00:20:24,517
How about
we see you next time?

459
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,937
How about you make an exception
and strap him in there?

460
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,147
Yeah, we're like 10 minutes
past your deadline anyways.

461
00:20:30,231 --> 00:20:31,774
And you don't want to
make us angry today.

462
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:33,901
Ladies, I really can't- “Ladies”?
No, no, no.

463
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:36,529
Seriously?

464
00:20:38,614 --> 00:20:41,992
And that was how
they apologized to me.

465
00:20:42,118 --> 00:20:44,328
- Whoo!
- Come on, Phil!

466
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:45,538
Go, Dad! Oh!

467
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:47,331
Go, Phil!

468
00:20:47,415 --> 00:20:49,875
Go, Daddy!

469
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:53,337
At least I- I think it was.
I could never ask them.

470
00:20:56,382 --> 00:20:59,093
This is so satisfying!

471
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:00,761
Best I've felt
all day!

472
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:05,975
Can I rent one of these
on a monthly basis?

473
00:21:07,852 --> 00:21:09,228
Yeah!
Yes!

474
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:11,105
Oh, yay!

475
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:12,440
Oh!

476
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:14,108
Best 40th birthday party ever.

477
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:16,026
No, no. Tenth.

478
00:21:16,152 --> 00:21:17,820
Really?
Yeah.

479
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:19,405
In fact, you're still
that sexy little...

480
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,407
eight-year-old
I fell in love with.

481
00:21:24,535 --> 00:21:27,663
Oh, um- No, just go.

482
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:33,544
English - US - PSDH
