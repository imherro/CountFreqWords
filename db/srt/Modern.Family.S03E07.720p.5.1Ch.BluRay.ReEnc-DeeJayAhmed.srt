1
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:06,508
- Honey, what is all this?
- Hey.

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,935
Hey, Mom, I'm trying to write this
stupid college essay question,

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,809
- and I really don't even know where to start.
- What's the question? Tell me.

4
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:16,017
"What's the biggest obstacle
you've ever had to overcome?"

5
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:19,023
Didn't my third-grade teacher
say I had, like, A.D.D. or something?

6
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:22,231
Oh, no, honey.
She said you couldn't A-D-D,

7
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:25,238
and she put it that way because she
also knew you couldn't S-P-E-L-L.

8
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,781
Wait. Slow down.

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,157
Ohh!

10
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:32,078
Sweetheart, what's this? We
talked about this last week.

11
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,706
I said I'm building Luke a tree house.
You said "Fine."

12
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:37,459
You know, sometimes I think
you just tune me out.

13
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:40,712
I never told her.
She just would've said no.

14
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,214
I don't remember agreeing
to this, Phil.

15
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,387
This is like the time you
backed down the driveway ...

16
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,135
with a hang glider
sticking out of the car.

17
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,717
If you'd let me keep that, those geese
would've followed me to the wetlands.

18
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:51,809
You would have died.
A hero.

19
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:57,604
So we spread out a nice blanket,
open up a bottle of vino ...

20
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:00,732
and watch the sun set
over the water.

21
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,320
It was majestic.  Mmm.

22
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,529
Majestic.
Majestic.

23
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:06,108
Ay. Why we never
have the picnic?

24
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:09,362
Who wants to sit on a blanket? There's
no back support. it's majestic.

25
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:13,574
Last week, Shorty took me
to see the Cirque du Soleil.

26
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:16,501
It's like a circus, but classy.

27
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:19,877
So if you like elephants,
don't hold your breath.

28
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,374
She's so cute.

29
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:25,586
Jay hate the crowds,
the beach, the rainbows.

30
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:27,763
Rainbows.
That's just colors in the sky.

31
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,723
Do we have to pull over every time
and take a picture?  Shame.

32
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,847
There's an expression
in Italian, Jay:

33
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:38,228
Dammi la tua mano e corriamo
uniti per tutta la vita.

34
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:42,028
"Give me your hand and we will
run together our whole lives."

35
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,696
Aww. Jay
also hates running.

36
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:54,992
# Hey, hey #

37
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,245
# Hey ##

38
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,374
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

39
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:03,173
- And here you go.
- Ohh. What is this?

40
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,296
You said to knock
your socks off.

41
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,299
Oh? Well, look. it's already working.

42
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:11,222
Two more of those, and you won't
be wearing any underwear either.

43
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,183
Oh, look!
Cam, down. Down.

44
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,018
Maybe later.
Oh, okay.

45
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,640
Maybe- Maybe later.

46
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,973
Did you hear that? The
waitress is flirting with me.

47
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,478
No, no. She's not
flirting with you.

48
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,811
She's trolling for tips, okay?
She totally knows you're gay.

49
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,646
How would she know I'm gay?

50
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:29,116
Uh, maybe it's the way you ordered
a "drink-a-doodle-doo."

51
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,735
Cam has this crazy theory that if he
were straight ...

52
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,537
And Julia Roberts were single,
they'd be dating.

53
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:38,334
It's not crazy. I met her once at an AIDS
walk, and our chemistry was palpable.

54
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,748
No, you handed her a bottle of water.
And her fingers lingered.

55
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,829
Because you wouldn't let go.

56
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,504
I could totally pick up
any woman in here.

57
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,712
If by that you mean lift her off the
ground, then yes, I'll give you that.

58
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,672
I for sure could be a womanizer.

59
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:55,009
Or you could be someone who just stepped
out a machine called The Womanizer.

60
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,515
Okay, you know what? That's it.
Pick anyone in here,

61
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,017
and if I can get their number,
you do the laundry for a month.

62
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:01,895
If I fail, I'll do it.

63
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,109
Okay, I hate doing
laundry, so, um- Mm-hmm.

64
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,858
No. Um-

65
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:08,985
Oh, okay.
Right here.

66
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,486
Her.

67
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:16,029
Okay, great. Great.

68
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,366
Just get rid of my flair.

69
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,792
Whoa. Where-
Where did Cam go?

70
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:24,337
Where is he?

71
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,253
- Dinner was absolutely wonderful.
- Amazing.

72
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:30,051
You know what? Why don't you guys come
salsa dancing with us tomorrow night?

73
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,970
Oh, yeah.
That would be great!

74
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,968
A y, it sounds like so much fun.
I love salsa dancing.

75
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,765
Jay, let's go
salsa dancing with them.

76
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,935
Look.

77
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,476
Why not? I just bought
that pay-per-view fight.

78
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,057
I'll tell you what.
We'll compromise.

79
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,268
We'll watch the fight,
we'll eat salsa.

80
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,229
- Who needs him? Come dancing with us.
- A y, no. I wouldn't want to-

81
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,530
No, no, you'd be
doing me a favor.

82
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,449
Shorty never wants to stop,
and I could use a break.

83
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,368
You hear that, Jay?
I never stop.

84
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:57,947
All I hear is
she could use a break.

85
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,793
Hey. Oh, my God.
How are you?

86
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,913
Hey. Hey!
Wow.

87
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,795
Look at you.
You look fantastic.

88
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,047
Thank you. S-So do you.

89
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,799
How long has it been?

90
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,887
F-Feels like forever.
Yeah.

91
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,261
What, um- When is the last
time we saw each other?

92
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,342
Oh, let's see. I think
it was at Dave's thing.

93
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,980
You know what?
I'm sorry.

94
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,182
I don't know
if you've heard.

95
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,142
I was in
a terrible car accident,

96
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:30,229
and ever since the coma,

97
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:34,362
I have a really hard time
placing names and faces.

98
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:37,032
So who are you again?
Oh, my God. I am so sorry.

99
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,535
It was just a clever way to try to approach you.
We don't know each other.

100
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,287
I've never been in a coma.

101
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,664
But you so deserved that.

102
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,963
That was
the worst pick-up ever.

103
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,003
Oh, my God!

104
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:54,086
That was genius
and mean!

105
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,218
Now I know why
we're old fake friends.

106
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,391
Can I buy you a drink?
Yeah.

107
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:02,807
I'm Katie.
Cameron.

108
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:06,356
If she were a hot guy, I would
never have been that smooth.

109
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,935
It's ironic.
Like the Gift of the Vagi.

110
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,690
There we go.

111
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,068
Thank you. Nice to meet you.
You too.

112
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,823
Bye.
Bye.

113
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,579
Wham, bam,
thank you, Cam.

114
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,074
Seriously. You got her number?
Sure did.

115
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:28,458
And all my shirts get ironed, and their seams
should appear straight, just like their owner.

116
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,680
Shouldn't you be using
screws instead of nails?

117
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,634
America was built
with nails, Son.

118
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:45,311
So was that gazebo you built
for our Fourth of July party.

119
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:48,186
I'm telling you,
you are gonna love this bad boy.

120
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:50,188
You know
what can't climb trees?

121
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,606
Raccoons?
Worries.

122
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,780
Raccoons can and will get up
here, so don't leave any food,

123
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,028
or they'll get territorial
and attack.

124
00:05:57,148 --> 00:06:00,527
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Are you kidding me?

125
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,988
You're gonna have so much fun hanging
out up here with your buddies.

126
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,415
Trust me. When you get
older, it all changes.

127
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,035
Why?
Well, life gets in the way.

128
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:12,001
Did I just say "wife gets in the way"?
'Cause sometimes I do that.

129
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,548
Nope, you're good.

130
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,091
And you have
lots of friends.

131
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,010
Yeah, I have work friends, and your
mom and I have couples friends,

132
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:22,057
and there are my college friends, but
they're scattered all over the country.

133
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,726
It's not the same as just shouting
out to your neighborhood buddies,

134
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,895
"Hey, fellas, I'm up here
in the tree house!"

135
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,440
Oh! I gotta fix
that ... board.

136
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:37,193
I can't do this. Why
are you so frustrated?

137
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,900
Because I've never had
any obstacles to overcome.

138
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,361
Oh, honey,
that's not true.

139
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,658
Really? Name one.
Well-

140
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,249
You're lactose
intolerant.

141
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:51,920
Oh. "Dear college, cheese makes me gassy.
See you in September."

142
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:55,295
Sweetie, you're not really starting
your essays "Dear college," are you?

143
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:59,594
What difference does it make? I've lived
a boring, sheltered, pathetic life.

144
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,889
I am sorry we have made things too
easy and comfortable for you.

145
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:06,264
Oh, you should be.
it is all your fault.

146
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:10,098
You have shielded me from everything
interesting and dangerous.

147
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,810
You are blaming me because I
kept you from getting hurt?

148
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,439
Gabby's mom's a hoarder.

149
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,566
That essay
practically writes itself.

150
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,115
Maybe it is our fault.

151
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,694
But did you ever consider
there's a reason?

152
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,370
What are you talking about?

153
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:30,667
There's a reason
why we were so easy on you.

154
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:34,212
- I don't understand.
- Oh, honey, you're old enough now.

155
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,506
- Old enough for what?
- The truth.

156
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,630
Okay, come on.
Gotta show you something.

157
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,963
- We're gonna go for a ride.
- Mom, just tell me.

158
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,011
You are my mom, right?

159
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,514
Oh, hey.

160
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,346
- I'm a bad man.
- Oh, no. What did you eat?

161
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,433
Mitchell, remember the girl
I met last night?

162
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:57,816
How can I forget her? She's super famous
for having the world's worst gaydar.

163
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,693
How could I be so cavalier
with her emotions?

164
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:03,742
You know, we had a real connection.
She gave me her number.

165
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,991
And right now, she's probably sitting
by the phone, waiting for me to call.

166
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,118
Uh-huh.

167
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:12,201
I don't think you understand
how charmed she was by me.

168
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:15,162
Oh, my God. Where did you
get all this self-confidence?

169
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:18,715
I won Cutest Baby
at the 1974 Jasper County Fair.

170
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,792
People at the time
said I could go Gerber.

171
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,841
You know what? I'm calling her.
What?

172
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,139
No, I can't carry this around.

173
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,592
I have to come clean so she
can move on with her life.

174
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,303
This is crazy. She
is not waiting by the-

175
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,730
Hi. Katie, it's Cam.

176
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,273
First ring.

177
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:39,774
- I was hoping I would call too.
- Oh, smooth.

178
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,356
So listen, I forgot
to mention something last night,

179
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:46,694
and I'm- I'm actually not really
quite sure how to say this.

180
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,370
"I'm a gay guy."

181
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,790
Um, it's actually
somewhat delicate.

182
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,867
"As am I,
on account of the gay."

183
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,123
No, no. I had a great
time with you too, Katie.

184
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,588
It's- Well, it's just that-
"I don't dig the ladies."

185
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:02,839
No, no, and I want you to sit. I want
you to have a seat on a chaise lounge.

186
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,841
Hey, you wanna go out and grab some
dinner before the fight tonight?

187
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,593
No, thank you.

188
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,140
Wanna eat at home?

189
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,593
I'll grill some steaks,
open a bottle of wine.

190
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,395
Whatever you want, because
I'm not going to be here.

191
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:17,395
She's going salsa dancing-
without me.

192
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:21,195
Ay, Manny, I told you.
it's a 21-and-over club.

193
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,692
A forbidden dance floor.
Only makes me want it more.

194
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:27,447
Wait a second. You're going
dancing with Shorty and Darlene?

195
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:31,621
Yes. Because even though he's old
like you, he still likes to have fun.

196
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:35,075
We like to have fun.
Last week, I took you to dinner.

197
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,911
Went to the boat show.
Got some sherbet.

198
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,543
And were home by 8:30
with no boat.

199
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,750
What do you want from me?
I don't like dancing.

200
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,547
I don't like sherbet.
Yeah, right.

201
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,048
How about coconut?

202
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,846
Who doesn't like the coconut?
Hmm? Who?

203
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,890
And anyways, I'm going
dancing with or without you.

204
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,933
Fine. I hope you have
a good time with Shorty.

205
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,636
I don't need Shorty.

206
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:58,314
I won't have any problem
finding a partner on my own.

207
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,142
Wow.
Way to rub it in, Mom.

208
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,777
How'd it go, heartbreaker?

209
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:10,531
That is one classy lady.
Which is why I couldn't tell her.

210
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,113
- What?
- Well, I just couldn't do it on the phone.

211
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,324
She seemed so excited
to hear from me,

212
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,750
and I'm very bad at
disappointing people, Mitchell.

213
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,749
Not all people.

214
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:23,082
Mama was right when she said my
charm was like a wild stallion.

215
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,542
If not properly bridled,
it'll bust down a barn.

216
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,549
Okay, you wanna get rid of your
girlfriend, tell her that story.

217
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,256
Maybe I will when she comes over.
She's coming over.

218
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,591
Are you serious?

219
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,597
She said she was in the
area, running errands.

220
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,599
What was I was supposed to say?
"Don't come over"?

221
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,897
Well, I guess I could've said
that, but it's too late now.

222
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,315
Plus, I wanna break it
to her gently.

223
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,063
So come on.
Help me un-gay the place.

224
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,437
You know what? I'll make it less gay by half.
Oh, these flowers should go too.

225
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,943
You mean the ones underneath the
portrait of you cuddling another man?

226
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,615
Oh, good catch.

227
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,743
Ohh!

228
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,323
Manny.
What's up, big guy?

229
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:59,917
How hard is it to learn this salsa
dancing stuff? Not hard at all.

230
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:04,544
It's about tapping into your emotion,
your passion and your inner fire.

231
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,216
Crap!

232
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:08,965
I stink at dancing.

233
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:12,138
First dance at our wedding, Gloria
was all graceful and gorgeous,

234
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:16,309
and I was all big and clunky, like
that scene from Beauty and the Beast

235
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,057
Actually, that was the song.

236
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,763
Manny picked it.

237
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,769
He didn't like me back then.

238
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,691
Salsa ]

239
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,939
Back straight.
Okay, do as I do.

240
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:28,692
Other leg.

241
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,741
Okay, stop marching. You're
dancing, not invading Poland.

242
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,369
Hello. Hi.
Looking for Jay Pritchett.

243
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:45,547
He's about 6'2", tough guy,
wrestles with homophobia.

244
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,165
The hell are you doing here?

245
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,841
I had to get
out of the house.

246
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:52,421
Cam needed a little alone time with
his new girlfriend. Don't ask.

247
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,846
Don't tell.

248
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,924
- What's going on here?
- He's learning to dance.

249
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,097
But he's just so tense.
It's not working out.

250
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,811
'Cause you're not letting go.
I'm trying.

251
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,935
Don't you think I wanna be all smooth
and make your mom happy out there?

252
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,937
But I just can't do it,
that's all.

253
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,609
Jay, I'm not giving up on you.

254
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,608
Okay. Hey, Manny, would
you give us a second?

255
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,901
Oh.
Thanks.

256
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,607
Dad, look.

257
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:16,035
L- I know this is weird,
but you and I are a lot alike.

258
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,862
You're self-conscious, okay?

259
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:21,662
So, um- Here. Just-
The hell is this?

260
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,120
It's just something that some people
take at clubs to, you know, loosen up.

261
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,705
You take this?

262
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,883
A gay man who hates dancing
lives in a sad and lonely little world.

263
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:33,633
This just melts your inhibitions,
and- and you can dance all night.

264
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,884
- Plus, it gives you a raging-
- I don't wanna-

265
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:39,009
I don't like this at all. Just
hold on to it, just in case.

266
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,594
Keep it. It's fine.

267
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,350
Jay, I'm gonna
show you something.

268
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,022
A farmer in New Zealand
taught a pig to dance.

269
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,601
Whoa.

270
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,903
See how he keeps
his snout up?

271
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,527
Oh, yeah. This is it.

272
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,200
This is what?

273
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:03,162
This.

274
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:07,162
I- I can't do this.
I can't get out of the car.

275
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:09,122
I'm sorry.
I'm too embarrassed.

276
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,170
Would you just tell me
what's going on? Okay.

277
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:15,675
I- I- I want you to go read
what's carved on that tree.

278
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,302
Mom, you're freaking me out.
Just do it.

279
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,884
Do it, Haley.

280
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,659
Have fun getting home!

281
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,832
There's your obstacle!

282
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,032
What?

283
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,164
Are you kidding me?

284
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,341
Oh! Son of a ... biscuit!

285
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,515
Why does that keep happening?
Maybe I need a nail gun.

286
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,888
Okay, that's it.
I'm out.

287
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,345
What do you mean, you're out?
Where are you going?

288
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:08,557
Dad, no offense, but I've
seen you with a glue gun.

289
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,392
I think a nail is gonna be
harder to get out of my hair.

290
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:14,355
No, don't go.
I'm doing this for you.

291
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:17,862
Are you, Dad? Are you?

292
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,443
The kid made me
think with that one.

293
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,279
Who was I really
doing this for?

294
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,412
Sometimes I just say,
"Are you, Dad? Are you?"

295
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:30,462
Because he gets real quiet and
doesn't notice when I walk away.

296
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:37,051
It's weird, because I feel so
comfortable around you already.

297
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,628
You know, last night,
when I got home,

298
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,338
I just started thinking ...

299
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:43,095
about all of the fun things
that we could do together.

300
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,218
You know?
Yeah.

301
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,555
I don't wanna scare you off, but my sister's
getting married in a couple of weeks,

302
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,437
and I so don't wanna go
to that thing alone.

303
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:53,018
Maybe you could be my date.

304
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:56,526
Katie, you're an amazing woman.

305
00:14:56,604 --> 00:15:00,734
You're smart, you're beautiful,
and how fun is that handbag?

306
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,743
This is gonna come
as a little bit of a shock.

307
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,325
I'm fairly gay.

308
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:12,914
Don't know why I said that.
I'm- I'm totally gay.

309
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,668
Just gay.

310
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:19,594
You're telling me you're gay?
Yeah.

311
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,213
Why? I was born that way.
You know, it's just-

312
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,014
No, why are you telling me?

313
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,014
I mean, I know you're gay.
it's obvious.

314
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:30,355
Well, it's not that- it's not that obvious.
It's- Oh, yeah.

315
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:34,105
The way you talk and walk and dress
and your theatrical hand gestures.

316
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,810
I do not have
theatrical hand gestures.

317
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:39,648
Okay, maybe I am
moderately expressive.

318
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,279
But why would you
give me your number?

319
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,326
Oh, because
I want a gay friend.

320
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:49,033
Someone I can dish with, give me
guy advice and I can shop with.

321
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,413
Those are totally
offensive stereotypes.

322
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,586
We could go see Julia
Roberts movies together.

323
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,834
I know her, and she's as nice
as she seems on screen.

324
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,127
Shut up. Really?
She is, yeah.

325
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,458
Is she?

326
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:02,671
So you were pretending to be
straight and hitting on me?

327
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,763
It's just a stupid bar bet.
What-

328
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,638
My
boyfriend- Oh, he's here.

329
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,470
Bet me that I couldn't get
a beautiful woman's number.

330
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,976
And as a proud gay man,
I know it shouldn't matter,

331
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:18,149
but I- I just wish everyone
could find me attractive. Ohh.

332
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,355
Now he's going to get to gloat.
I guess I deserve it.

333
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,492
Hi.  Hi.

334
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,410
How's- How's it going?

335
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,074
Hello.
This is Katie.

336
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,498
And it turns out,
uh, well-

337
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:34,373
No, actually,
it doesn't turn out well.

338
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:38,832
Because I thought I finally
met a nice, funny guy ...

339
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,883
who is also hot!

340
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,507
And now he's
telling me he's gay?

341
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,759
He's like
the least gay person ...

342
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,261
I have ever met
in my entire life!

343
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:51,345
And I thought
he was the one!

344
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,727
And I even told
my mom about him!

345
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,773
You better cherish him!

346
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,776
Hello. Wow.

347
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:13,332
Are you sure you're gay? No.

348
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,909
- Cam.
- Yes.

349
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,207
Yes.

350
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,130
Look, you're gonna
find somebody ...

351
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,753
because you're
an amazing girl, Katie.

352
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,926
You're the whole package.

353
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:27,426
I just prefer somebody
who has one.

354
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,799
Okay.

355
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,482
Oh, my God.

356
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,437
That was a lot of girl tongue.

357
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,772
I think I need
a drink-a-doodle-doo.

358
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,827
What was that?

359
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,996
Hello, Haley.
How was your day?

360
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,620
I had no money,
no cell phone-

361
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:55,951
You're welcome.

362
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,998
What?
I listened to you.

363
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,547
I stopped coddling you.
And look. You overcame an obstacle.

364
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,420
Oh, yeah, I did.

365
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,797
I grew up normal
despite my crazy mom!

366
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,844
Well, that sounds like the
beginning of a great essay.

367
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,422
"Dear college"-

368
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,724
Oh, honey, if you get stuck,
let me know,

369
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,301
and I'll make you
sleep out in the yard.

370
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,728
- You're psychotic!
- Use spell check.

371
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,556
Salsa ]

372
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,519
Whoo!

373
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,442
Aaah!

374
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,944
Don't just sit there!
Get out here!

375
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:31,324
- I'm good. I'm good.
- Okay.

376
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:34,121
¡Hola! You're looking so good.
How long has it been?

377
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,994
We don't know each other.
Go away.

378
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,916
Fair enough.

379
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:41,542
¡Hola! You're looking so good.
How long has it been?

380
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,590
What was wrong
with that guy?

381
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,383
I would've danced with him.
He's got nice shoulders.

382
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,803
Oh, you know, salsa is
so intimate and sensual ...

383
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:52,223
that it feels wrong to do it with
somebody else that is not Jay.

384
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,762
Aw. Yeah, Darlene
feels the same way.

385
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,764
If I wasn't here, she'd
be holding up the wall.

386
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,221
Yeah. A wall of men.

387
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:01,478
You know, I think I should go
home to my loving husband ...

388
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,982
and pull him close and tell him
that I danced with 20 men.

389
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,730
He's not home.

390
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,032
He's in a dicey neighborhood,
worried about his car.

391
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,576
¡Ay, no!

392
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,029
Jay, you-

393
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,121
Mwah! What, are we
gonna kiss or dance?

394
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,491
Let's dance. Come, come.

395
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,669
I'm dead set against drugs.
Just say no and all that stuff.

396
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:25,920
But I thought-
just this once, for Gloria.

397
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:31,930
And if I was gonna make a complete ass
of myself, I didn't wanna remember it.

398
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,927
The big drug I gave him-
baby aspirin.

399
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,604
Orange flavored.
He could have chewed it.

400
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:46,110
How come you never
surprise me like that?

401
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:49,527
I do surprise you. No, you don't.
You never surprise me.

402
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,033
That's gonna be
a hell of a tree house.

403
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:03,211
Oh. Thanks.
I'm trying.

404
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,538
It's for my son,
but he's kind of lost interest.

405
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,373
It's kind of like my daughter
with the dog,

406
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,548
which is why
I'm the one ...

407
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,625
out here doing this.

408
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,212
Did you just move in?

409
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,638
Lived here eight years.
You?

410
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,307
Twelve.

411
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:18,384
- Huh.
- Huh.

412
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,516
Me and my friends, we built a
tree house when I was a kid.

413
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,939
We spent hours in that thing.
Loved it.

414
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,732
Me too.

415
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,810
You need any help?

416
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,024
Yes. A lot.

417
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:32,198
But I- I don't
wanna bother you.

418
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:35,117
Only thing bothering me is that
drunken Amish roof you got up there.

419
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,739
- Do you even have a level?
- I did.

420
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:40,198
But I might've gotten frustrated
and thrown it into your yard.

421
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,166
Let me find it. I'll be right over.
Thanks.

422
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,994
I'm Phil, by the way.

423
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,375
I'm Andre.
Nice to meet you, Phil.

424
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,423
Nice to meet you, Andre.

425
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:54,095
So I guess I was wrong when I said once
you get older, it's harder to make new friends.

426
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,013
Honey, the dude
in the tree is cool!

427
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,308
Andre, it turns out,
is an orthopedic surgeon,

428
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,808
handy with tools
and a great guy to hang out with.

429
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:06,687
Plus, he's a bad-ass black man
that gives me extra street cred.

430
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,235
That's his joke.

431
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,733
He's my brotha
from a different motha.

432
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,323
What was that?
Different-

433
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,783
That's not it.
What is it?

434
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,948
It's brotha from anotha motha.
Brotha from anotha motha.

435
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,620
Slow down.
Slow it down.

436
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,242
Brotha from anotha motha.

437
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,541
Forget it. Don't- Just don't say it.
Forget it.

438
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,372
