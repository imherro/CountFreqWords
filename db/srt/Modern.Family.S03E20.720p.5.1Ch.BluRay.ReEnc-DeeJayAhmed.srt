1
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:06,674
We have to tell him.

2
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:08,259
I hope he's okay.

3
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:10,811
Walt, our elderly
next-door neighbor, died.

4
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:13,309
He and Luke were pretty close,
so we have to tell him.

5
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:14,810
I'm a little nervous
about it.

6
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:17,981
I think we should break it
to him slowly. Like how?

7
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:23,073
Well, first we'd say, "Luke, your friend Walt has a cold.
You shouldn't go over there."

8
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,617
Next day, "Bad news.
WaIt's in the hospital,

9
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,535
but he's still crackin' jokes
with the nurses."

10
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,831
Next day, "They're trying an experimental drug.
Fingers crossed."

11
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:33,625
Next day, "His body rebelled.
He's in a coma."

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,203
Next day, he rallies.
Next day, coma.

13
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:39,290
Next day, coma. Next day, coma.
Next day, eye flutter-

14
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,626
Stop. Just stop. Stop.

15
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:46,839
Oh. Luke, we have some bad news for you.
it's about Walt.

16
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:49,471
I'm afraid ...

17
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,020
he passed away.

18
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,556
Um, it happened yesterday.

19
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,438
He finished writing an angry letter
to the Postmaster General,

20
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,235
and he just fell asleep.

21
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,562
Okay.

22
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:04,819
It was very peaceful.

23
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,151
Not the letter.
That was full of threats, but-

24
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,867
it's okay
to be sad, honey.

25
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:12,414
You two were
really good friends.

26
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:17,120
It must be quite a shock
to hear that WaIt's dead.

27
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:22,507
Um, so do you want to
talk about it, or-

28
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:26,213
I'm okay. Can I get back to
my video game? It's paused.

29
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:30,266
Oh. Um, sure.
Yeah, buddy.

30
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,637
Come here.

31
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,933
How weird was that?

32
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:37,811
I know.
Crazy weird.

33
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,733
It's like he had
no feelings at all.

34
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,403
I'm more worried about the one you showed.
What's with all the smiling?

35
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,946
What are you
talking about?

36
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:48,322
That grin. "WaIt's dead."
You looked like the Joker.

37
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:51,446
I didn't smile. You did. it's
like a weird coping mechanism.

38
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,077
You did the same thing
when you told him his hamster died.

39
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:57,122
I don't know what you
thought you saw, Phil,

40
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,875
but our child just got some terrible
news and had absolutely no reaction.

41
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,956
Doesn't that concern you?

42
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,509
Yeah. He probably just
needs time to process it.

43
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:07,757
Hmm. Do you think?

44
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,551
Yeah, honey.

45
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,850
Death is a profound thing to deal with at any age.
We all manage it differently.

46
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,136
Some people lock up
their feelings.

47
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:19,143
Others reach out for comfort,

48
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,852
finding some way to reaffirm
their connection to life.

49
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,607
Are you joking?

50
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,106
# Hey, hey #

51
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,192
# Hey, hey #

52
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,323
# Hey, hey #

53
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,279
# Hey, hey #

54
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:35,535
# Hey ##

55
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,828
Haley?
Hey, Gloria.

56
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,915
I was driving by and saw this
outside your door, so here.

57
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,507
Thank you.
No problem.

58
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,426
Hey. So, since
I'm already here,

59
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:52,052
my friend was going to have a pool
party tonight, but he got sick.

60
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:56,097
Could we have it here? Mm, good
thing that you saw this paper,

61
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,396
- or if not, you would have never been able to ask.
- Yeah.

62
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:03,726
I'm sorry. But Jay and I are going to
Mitch and Cam's for dinner tonight.

63
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:05,937
I'm just thinking
out loud here.

64
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:10,195
What if I get a chaperone that my parents approve of?
Would it be okay then?

65
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,696
Well, I guess so.

66
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,780
You know, it would be good
for Manny to have a little bit of fun.

67
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,206
Do you mind if he stays here
for the party?

68
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,875
Mind? The plan
depended on him.

69
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,953
I don't suppose you've
thought of a chaperone.

70
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,710
Of course not, Mom, because
it's going to be a wild party,

71
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,666
and I'm trying to get away
with something, as usual.

72
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,218
Yes, I've thought of a chaperone- my
uncle, who already said he would do it.

73
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,762
But if that's going to be a problem,
I should just call everybody-

74
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,306
Sorry, sorry, sorry. It's fine.

75
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,930
And thank you, Uncle Manny.

76
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,679
Can you help a little bit?
if I push down, does that-

77
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:44,149
Yeah, that's helpin'. That's helpin',
but- it's not helping. It's stuck.

78
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,726
I can't believe
I've got 'em this stuck.

79
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:48,779
I built beds my whole life.
Bunk beds, dog beds, cow beds.

80
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,863
I'm calling you on cow beds.

81
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,408
Oh, that's my dad!
Oh. Okay, he can help.

82
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,406
He's built a boat,
a dock, a lake.

83
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:59,615
Ah, he did not build a lake. Okay, from now
on, just stop after you say the second thing.

84
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:04,078
So the cabin door swings open. Damned
if there wasn't a lady pilot in there.

85
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:07,631
Yeah, well, I hate to admit
it, but it throws me too.

86
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:11,298
I do prefer a man. Are we gonna
have this conversation again?

87
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,386
Hey, Merle.
Hey. How are you?

88
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,803
Okay. Let me grab that for you.
No, no, I got it.

89
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:19,385
I will take that beer
you were about to offer me though.

90
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:23,139
Oh, yeah, coming right up. And you know
where everything is. Go have a seat.

91
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,848
Oh, I missed a call
from my dad.

92
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,559
Oh, let me guess.
Is he calling to cancel?

93
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,110
What's his excuse this time?

94
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,735
You know, that's a really
mean thing to assume, Cam.

95
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,032
I really wish you'd give
my dad a break for once.

96
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,780
Oh, please. You know Jay
doesn't like my dad.

97
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,237
He thinks he's some bumpkin
from the sticks.

98
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:42,457
Well, I will have you know that Merle Stonewall
Tucker is one of the most respected farmers ...

99
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,455
in all of Hell's Hollow, Missouri.

100
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,287
Okay, you're not
hearing yourself.

101
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,756
- My dad likes him just fine.
- Come on.

102
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,052
Hello.
Hey, Dad, it's me.

103
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,129
Mitch.

104
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:59,558
I'm sick.
I gotta cancel tonight.

105
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:03,729
Yeah. Yeah, at 6:00. We're
really lookin' forward to it.

106
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,226
What are you doing?
I said I can't come.

107
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,809
I don't know. Let me ask. My dad
wants to know red or white.

108
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,485
Um, uh, red.

109
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,104
Red.
And I'm sorry.

110
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:15,157
Okay. Yeah,
Cam says red.

111
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,984
Okay.
Yeah, he-he's so happy-

112
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,820
Knock it off, old man! You are not sick.
Why do you always do this?

113
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,656
Okay, look. Between you and
me, Mervis kind of bugs me.

114
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,993
First of all, it's Merle. Mervis isn't a name.
Mervis is a sound.

115
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:29,546
And second of all, he's my partner's
father, okay? You're coming.

116
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,464
Okay, Dad,
why don't you settle in?

117
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,918
We don't have any plans until
dinner tonight with Jay and Gloria.

118
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,096
- I don't like that guy.
- What? That's- You like everybody.

119
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,050
Not Jay.
Guy rubs me the wrong way.

120
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:46,104
Every time I try to do somethin' nice,
he makes this cranky face, like-

121
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,897
Okay. Well, you know what?

122
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:52,315
I'm gonna chalk this up to jet lag for you,
because it's not like you at all, okay?

123
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:55,318
You have to make an effort.
it's my partner's father.

124
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,149
Now, give me the growl
that means okay.

125
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,360
Good.

126
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:04,323
Did you know Walt had a daughter
he was completely estranged from?

127
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:08,293
His lawyer said she wouldn't even honor his
last request to toss his dog tags in the ocean.

128
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,209
Can you imagine? Phil, do we really
have to go through this again?

129
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:12,961
I told you I would do
everything possible ...

130
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,259
to make sure that your skeleton ends up
in a science class at a women's college.

131
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,382
No, it's just sad.

132
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,260
That's half of what will
keep me going in my old age.

133
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,430
Remembering all the good
times with the kids. Oh.

134
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,353
Teaching Luke
to ride his bike.

135
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:29,978
Haley at
the father-daughter dance.

136
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,643
Taking Alex for
her first pony ride.

137
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,946
You never took Alex
on a pony ride.

138
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,948
Oh, right, that was just me.
Mm-hmm.

139
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:42,528
But Alex and I went, um-
Oh, no, that was Haley.

140
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,739
Mmm.
Huh.

141
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,995
Phil. Look, it's Luke.
He's going into WaIt's house.

142
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,078
Aw.

143
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,422
He's saying good-bye.

144
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,841
He just needed
a little time.

145
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:00,967
That is so sweet
and so sad. Wow.

146
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:04,266
He's so much more sensitive
than I ever thought.

147
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,469
They had a special bond.

148
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:10,101
I wouldn't be surprised if one day he
wrote a book like Tuesdays With Morrie.

149
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:13,441
I never read it.
Did that guy steal Morrie's TV?

150
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,663
Now setting a course
for adventure.

151
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,661
# Beep-boop-beep-bop
boop-boop-boop #

152
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,461
I've had great experiences
with all my kids, but I-

153
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,754
I might have fallen
behind a bit with Alex.

154
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,422
My fault completely.

155
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:39,422
Adventure? We are throwing dog tags
into an already polluted ocean ...

156
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,754
where they will probably
choke an otter.

157
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,089
Eighty percent my fault.

158
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:47,722
Honey, we're bringing closure
to a man's life.

159
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,428
We'll hike up to
the scenic overlook-

160
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:51,639
where apparently Walt
proposed to his wife-

161
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:55,771
wait for the light to be just right,
say a few words, share some memories.

162
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,649
It's kind of poetic.
Kind of Navaho.

163
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,526
Now you're getting it.

164
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,654
We'll be sending him off with a level
of dignity that, if we're lucky,

165
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,576
some day we'll experience too.

166
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,154
It's called-

167
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,624
Huh.

168
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,468
Hey, what have you got there?
WaIt's old TV?

169
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,891
He said that I could take
one thing after he died.

170
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,593
I wish he would
have said two things.

171
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,678
I would have taken that phone
with the big buttons.

172
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:36,358
I bet you guys had some really good
times watching this thing, right?

173
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,652
No. I just wanted
a TV in my room.

174
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:44,525
You know, Luke, there might be a
nicer way to honor WaIt's memory.

175
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:48,828
- What do you mean?
- Well, I mean, you guys liked to garden.

176
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:52,828
We could, uh- We could take one of his
flowers and plant it in our yard.

177
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,793
And then every spring, when-

178
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,914
Ah, there we go.

179
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:02,092
Sweetie, how you feeling?

180
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,636
Are you sad? Angry?

181
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:08,181
Confused? Frustrated?
You know, you can talk to me.

182
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,975
I know, but I can't see through you.
Could you scooch?

183
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:14,681
No, no. You know, this is not okay.
it's going back.

184
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,774
What? He said I could pick one thing.
This isn't picking.

185
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,476
It's looting,
and it's going back.

186
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,687
Oh! You are so mean.

187
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,613
When Walt used to look through
those binoculars ...

188
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,692
and say, "Your dad's one
lucky man," he was wrong.

189
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:32,289
Hi, Haley. Hi. Stef,
Sam, this is Manny.

190
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,533
What's up, dude? Kitchen's over
there and pool's in the back.

191
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,955
So where are your parents?
They're not coming.

192
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:40,206
I was told there'd be a chaperone.
There is. It's you.

193
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,790
My parents are totally
fine with it.

194
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:46,629
Well, exits, fire
extinguisher, burn kit.

195
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,304
Okay, let's have some fun.

196
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,345
Y;  I believe it was
clear the bedrooms are off-limits.

197
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:55,429
Young lady, I don't think you're ready up
here for what you're planning to do up there.

198
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,233
Not on my watch.

199
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,856
Oh, this was
a delicious meal, Mitchell.

200
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:09,284
I wish my wife could cook
a roast like this.

201
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,994
You got a good 'un there, Son.
Well, I'm very lucky.

202
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,949
never had a bad patch.

203
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,874
Except the winter of '85.
Remember that?

204
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,547
Oh, I spent several nights
in the cow bed then. Hmm.

205
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,921
Oh, here. Let me help you. No, no, no.
You sit- sit down.

206
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:29,421
Let's us guys catch up
here a little bit. Yeah.

207
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:32,641
I'll tell you why I don't like that guy,
and I could never say this to Mitch.

208
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:36,470
He treats my son like the wife
in the relationship. Always has.

209
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:39,932
Before we get to dessert,
I've got some presents here.

210
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,933
- Oh, you didn't need to, Dad.
- Ay-

211
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,269
Love it.

212
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:47,856
Oh, Merle,
thank you so much.

213
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:51,239
Look at this.
Oh, so elegant, huh?

214
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,537
Oh, this is so sweet.
I think I might cry.

215
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,239
Don't.

216
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,824
Dad, I've really
gotta get home-

217
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,786
I know, I know,
you gotta do homework.

218
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,915
You can't expect me to see a sign that says
"World's Greatest Milk Shake, 50 Miles" ...

219
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,716
and not drive to it.

220
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,509
Sorry, sweetie.
Machine's broken.

221
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,007
Huh.

222
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,885
I just wanted a special day
with my daughter, you know?

223
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:16,969
Like the time we gave an old man a
dramatic send-off at the beach.

224
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:21,773
Or-Or the time we drove a hundred miles
for the world's greatest milk shake.

225
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,850
Call us when it
happens, Francine.

226
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,526
Oh, could be
before you get home.

227
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,400
I'm a week past
my due date as it is.

228
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,355
What can I do for you?

229
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:33,615
The time
we delivered a baby.

230
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,616
We were the only ones there,
and she was so close.

231
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,073
The sound of a pin dropping
could induce labor.

232
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,454
Okay.

233
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,035
What looks good?

234
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,588
What looks good?
What looks good?

235
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,299
Well, uh-

236
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:52,428
Barn!

237
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,925
Whoa!

238
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,303
- Kids love to destroy things.
- Not Manny.

239
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,635
He's always been
a little bit too serious.

240
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,722
I would make the buildings,
and he will inspect them,

241
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:05,604
and if they weren't up to code-
ay, ay, ay, the paperwork.

242
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:10,280
I remember Cam one time rolled a
tractor tire right through a chicken coop.

243
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,449
He was three at the time.

244
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:16,744
Huh. Yeah, I remember Mitchell one time
karate chopped a plate glass window.

245
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,705
Got 17 stitches.
Ay, yes, I love that story.

246
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:22,079
Which one of the Charlie's
Angels he was being again?

247
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,498
It's not important.
I think it was Farrah.

248
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,501
Yeah, the thing I remember
is when Mitchell told that story,

249
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:30,250
how he giggled all the way through it.
I'm sure he wasn't giggling.

250
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:34,088
Oh, yeah, he-he was giggling, all right.

251
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,843
No, see, Mitchell
has a booming laugh.

252
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,674
It's Cameron, actually,
has the high laugh.

253
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,759
You know-

254
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:44,018
No, I believe Mitch has a higher
laugh than-

255
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,724
No, it's-

256
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,442
Listen to them.

257
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,944
- Listen to them. Best of friends.
- Oh, man.

258
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:57,027
I'm sorry I doubted Jay.
He's been lovely.

259
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,614
Oh, well, confession time.
He kind of didn't want to come.

260
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,620
Oh.

261
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:06,124
Well, you're gonna laugh, because my
dad was kind of hoping he wouldn't.

262
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,417
Wha-

263
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:12,217
They just needed to get to know one another better.
I am so glad that we did this.

264
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,839
Yeah, me too.

265
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,636
Oh.

266
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:19,633
That's so funny. What did your dad not
like about my dad? Oh, well, you know Jay.

267
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:23,266
He's a teddy bear, but sometimes he
can kind of come off as a tough guy.

268
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,187
Yeah, that's true.

269
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:28,605
As an actual tough guy, you can kind of see
how that would rub my dad the wrong way.

270
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,479
Oh, that's-
I-l could see that.

271
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,691
But, you know, my dad's actually
pretty tough himself, so-

272
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:39,152
Oh, yeah. City tough.
You know, not farm tough.

273
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,909
Uh-huh. You mean, cities,
where there are gangs,

274
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,958
as opposed to farms,
where there are ducks?

275
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,378
Boy, that's really
jammed in there.

276
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,127
Yep. Why don't you
hop on in there, Dad?

277
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:54,300
- My dad's got it.
- All right, let's see here. Hang on, Merle.

278
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,672
Here.  That's good.

279
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,595
It's comin'.

280
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,844
- We got it. We got it.
- Oh, there you go.

281
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,301
Cam, why don't you go get us
a couple of cold ones?

282
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,057
We'll finish
this job up in here.

283
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:06,729
Sure thing, Dad.
You earned it.

284
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,102
Yeah. Good helpin' there,
Merle. Okay.

285
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,405
Wow. It's hot in here.
It's like 80 degrees.

286
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,734
He did that so the Meals On Wheels
lady had to take off her sweater.

287
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,443
How do we turn on
the lights in here?

288
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,409
Of course.

289
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:29,161
So, Luke. Now that we're here, you want to
take a minute and say what Walt meant to you?

290
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,041
Nope.

291
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,748
Luke, you are going through
something huge in your life,

292
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:37,881
and I'm concerned that you're not
processing it in a normal, healthy way.

293
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,429
I'm sad.
I'm so very sad.

294
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:43,679
No, I don't just want to hear what you think
I want to hear. I want you to really-

295
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,556
Hi. it's Kim
with Meals on Wheels.

296
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,474
Oh. Hi, Luke. Where's Walt?

297
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:52,935
It is like a sauna in here. How does he stand it?
Walt! I'm waiting for my hug!

298
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:58,440
I have some sad news
about Walt.

299
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,527
He's dead.
What?

300
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,489
- He died last night.
- Are you joking?

301
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,994
No.
He had a heart attack.

302
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,792
A man died.
You're-You're smiling.

303
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,004
I'm not smiling. You are, Mom.
It's kinda creepy.

304
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,127
Hello! Walt?

305
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,708
What's goin' on?

306
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:20,091
Something happen to Walt?
Mm-hmm.

307
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,763
- Well, I'm sure you can imagine.
- He's sick?

308
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,303
He's in the hospital?

309
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,681
Oh, my God. Just tell me.

310
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,731
Okay. He is dead.

311
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:34,184
- He is?
- Yeah, he's dead.

312
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,814
What are you doin'
with your mouth?

313
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,403
Nothing.  She's smiling.

314
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,022
She thinks it's funny.
I don't.

315
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,607
I don't think it's funny.
I'm not-

316
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,324
I'm not leaving this with you.
I'm sorry.

317
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,700
I'm so sorry. I just found
out my face does this.

318
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,325
Wow, Mom,
that was so wrong.

319
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:50,534
Well, it's-it's called
a coping mechanism, Luke.

320
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:54,416
Some people repress their feelings,
and some people just smile.

321
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:57,965
It- It doesn't matter. Just put the TV in the den.
Let's get out of here.

322
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,010
It doesn't go in the den.

323
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,053
It goes right here.

324
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,425
I can see it from my room.

325
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:11,388
Sometimes I'd wake up in the middle
of the night and look down here.

326
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:15,271
If the TV was on,
I knew he was up.

327
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,774
I don't know.
I guess I'm gonna miss that.

328
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,399
Yeah, that's-

329
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:23,904
Yeah.

330
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:28,743
Oh.

331
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,373
Is that any better?
Yeah.

332
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,871
It still feels just,
you know, a little wobbly.

333
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,998
Oh! Oh, my God.
Okay, no, no, no.

334
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,171
That's-That's fine.
Thank you. Thank you.

335
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,247
Ohh!

336
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:41,505
Okay. it's go time.

337
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,586
Oh. Hey, Doc.

338
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,965
Huh. That's okay.
It's just a cramp.

339
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,766
Can I get you guys
anything else?

340
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,811
Please, no. He's already made me eat the
world's greatest everything on the menu.

341
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,314
Dad, why are you
acting like this?

342
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,891
Is this about Walt dying?

343
00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:01,104
No. it's about what he didn't do
when he was alive-

344
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,689
have a special bond
with his daughter.

345
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,195
I don't want to be that kind of dad.
I want to be Eugene Cernan.

346
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:08,786
Who's Eugene Cernan? Apollo 17 astronaut.
Last man on the moon.

347
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,910
Coolest dad of all time.
When he was leaving the moon,

348
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,788
he reached down and wrote his daughter's
initials into the lunar surface.

349
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:19,085
Since there's no atmosphere-
They'll be there forever.

350
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:23,509
Wow. So every time she looks in the sky,
she knows there's a message just for her.

351
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,463
Exactly. That's why dads
everywhere hate Eugene Cernan.

352
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:27,843
Oh, no.

353
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:30,550
Okay, hate's a strong word.
it's just I'm trying to make-

354
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:33,933
Oh. Oh, boy.

355
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,684
Honey. Okay.

356
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:40,231
I really want to help, but you know
when someone yawns, it makes you yawn?

357
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,936
You're not gonna yawn,
are you?

358
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,942
I already yawned
a little in my mouth.

359
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:48,823
Jay, I want to thank you
for helping me do this.

360
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:52,826
I know Cam appreciates
not having to do it all on his own.

361
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,705
What?
What's that face?

362
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,579
You really want to know?
Sure.

363
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:03,838
Sometimes I think you treat my son
like the woman in their relationship.

364
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,918
- What?
- Like those watches.

365
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:08,380
Cam's was all big and manly.

366
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:11,306
The other one looked like
something Grace Kelly would wear.

367
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:16,058
Well, that's just because Mitch has a more
slender wrist than Cam does. That's all.

368
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,889
It's skinny, not slender.

369
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:21,818
And you're honestly tellin' me you don't
cast Mitch in the more ladylike role?

370
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,236
Are you sayin' Cam is
the wife in this deal?

371
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:26,781
I don't think about it that way.
it's not like it was in our day.

372
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:29,780
Husband went out to work.
Wife stayed home with the kids.

373
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,453
That sounds like
a clever way of saying yes.

374
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,871
Fine.

375
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,458
They're both equal.

376
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,456
Neither one is the wife.

377
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:43,585
Yeah, yeah.
I know that in my head.

378
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:47,840
It's just that it makes me
feel a tiny bit better ...

379
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:54,346
to think that the person he's spending
his life with is a tiny bit of a woman.

380
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,474
I get it.

381
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,432
Every time I start to feel
comfortable with this thing,

382
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:03,814
some new part comes up
I gotta wrap my head around.

383
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:07,063
Yeah. I guess we got no choice.
Yep.

384
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:12,115
We got two sons, and they're
gay for each other. Hmm.

385
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:15,163
I'll take it slow
on the way home.

386
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,490
Don't worry. Canceling
course for adventure.

387
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,826
# Beep-boop-beep-bap-boop #

388
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,582
You know what
I'll never forget?

389
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:26,258
The time my dad spent an entire day
trying to create a special memory for me.

390
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,013
Or when a pregnant lady
slipped in my vomit.

391
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,343
Hang on.

392
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,100
I want to do one thing
before we go.

393
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,478
Hey.
You on your way home?

394
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,276
Just about.
How's everything there?

395
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:55,745
Actually, it's pretty great.
I can't wait to see you.

396
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,868
Me too.

397
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,574
Okay.

398
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,669
Let's hit it.

399
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,587
I don't know.

400
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:08,712
Feel like maybe we should get
some food on the way home.

401
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:09,792
Don't.

402
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,514
Maybe a nice tuna melt.
Stop it.

403
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,734
I did what I could, Mom.

404
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:31,531
It was a nightmare. I can't tell you how
many times I turned off the bathroom light.

405
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:32,731
Haley!

406
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,656
Oh, crap. Listen, Gloria.

407
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:38,409
Okay. Everything I told you
technically was not-

408
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:42,117
You lied to me so that you could
have a party without supervision!

409
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,452
Oh, I had plenty
of supervision.

410
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:47,288
He was running around all night
with his coasters and vacuum ...

411
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,998
and his
"make good choices" speech.

412
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:51,967
Good. Somebody needed to be responsible.
Thank you.

413
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,340
Not you. You take rules
too seriously.

414
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,843
- I'm in trouble?
- You are 13.

415
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,924
You're not supposed to be
vacuuming the party.

416
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:02,474
You're supposed to be
enjoying the party. Exactly.

417
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:04,726
A party that you
shouldn't have been having!

418
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,478
Seems like you're
sending mixed signals here.

419
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:08,776
Yeah. Maybe I should get
my friends and leave-

420
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:11,821
No, you're in trouble, little young lady.
You're having this party.

421
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:14,274
What? They've been using
glassware by the pool,

422
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,950
putting feet on the furniture and
begging girls to kiss each other.

423
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:20,872
Yes. All the things that
you should have been doing!

424
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:25,076
Yeah, all those things are fine.
Go. Have fun and go crazy!

425
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:26,786
But he's gonna
ruin my party.

426
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:29,543
Two birds with one bullet.

427
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,921
