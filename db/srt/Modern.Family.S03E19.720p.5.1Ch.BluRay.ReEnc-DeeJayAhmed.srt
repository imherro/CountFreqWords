1
00:00:02,628 --> 00:00:05,802
Councilwoman Dunphy,
how do you respond to allegations ...

2
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:08,555
that you look super sexy
in your new suit?

3
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:10,011
I haven't been
elected yet.

4
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:12,346
Come on, kids!
We gotta vote!

5
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:14,849
Honey, come on. Please stop filming.
I'm just excited.

6
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:18,482
After today, you are
going to be a Councilwoman,

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,813
and I am going to be
a first husband.

8
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:23,490
Well, if you don't stop filming,
you're going to be my first husband.

9
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,033
All right, everybody,
come on!

10
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,701
You know what you're doing, kids?

11
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:29,656
You guys are manning the phone banks.
Alex, you're in charge of that.

12
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,580
What? Why is she in charge? And
wh-what's a phone bank? That's why.

13
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,122
Phil?
I got it.

14
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:38,001
I will be driving 50 of our finest
senior citizens to the polls,

15
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,378
assuming, of course, that they
remember that I'm coming for them.

16
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:41,796
Redirect.
High five.

17
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:44,170
- Old people occasionally forget things.
- Okay.

18
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:47,093
All right, everybody, let's go. Wait, wait.
Real quick. Sorry.

19
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,095
Everybody get in there.
Jump in there.

20
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:52,269
I just want to say how
proud of you we all are.

21
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,187
You're an inspiration.

22
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:57,107
Who would've thought that 20 years ago, when
you were still in the bloom of your youth-

23
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,059
Okay, I'm gonna
go start the car.

24
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,644
Claire likes to win.

25
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,946
When she was eight,
a little Girl Scout friend of hers ...

26
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,319
bragged she could
sell the most cookies.

27
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,322
Damned if Claire didn't
walk the neighborhood ...

28
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,324
till she got blisters
on her feet,

29
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:10,871
and won by 10 boxes.

30
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:14,621
Best part is, Claire
wasn't even a Girl Scout.

31
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,752
The choice is Claire.

32
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:21,253
Vote Claire Dunphy
for town council!

33
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,084
What?  Oh, I love it!

34
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,169
- What do you think, huh?
- I love it.

35
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:27,880
We got it on Craigslist.

36
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:32,635
- Came off a taco truck.
- It did.

37
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:35,062
I love that you're doing this for me.
Thank you!

38
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:36,980
You 're welcome!

39
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,648
I know how important
winning is to Claire.

40
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,735
And I love to festoon things.
We're her dream team.

41
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,609
So we cleared the whole day, dropped Lily
off at school and voted first thing.

42
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:48,693
Although one of us had a bit
of a dimpled chad situation.

43
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,698
Can you tell me how this
machine works again, Chad?

44
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,496
Oh, sure,
no problem.

45
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:55,791
Just vote over here. Just-

46
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:05,085
# Hey, hey #

47
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,339
# Hey ##

48
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,968
Thank you.
Thank you.

49
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:15,136
I can see Claire-ly now
that Duane is gone!

50
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,097
Bye! Thank you!

51
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,808
Oh, my gosh. Okay, everybody, get in the car.
Let's go, let's go.

52
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,359
Good luck today, Claire.

53
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:23,936
Oh, Laurie, thank you.

54
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,942
By the way, we have
some really good news.

55
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:28,191
What's that? Becky got into
the University of Oregon.

56
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,150
Oh, congratulations.

57
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,735
Any news, Haley?

58
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,286
Uh, no, not- not yet.

59
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,615
But, you know,
super psyched!

60
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,199
This whole waiting to hear thing ...

61
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,034
has been a nightmare
since the very first letter.

62
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,663
I'm too nervous.
I can't do it.

63
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,003
"Dear Ms. Dunphy,

64
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,085
we regret
to inform you-"

65
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:53,720
What?
Don't leave me hanging.

66
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,803
After that, I decided to only
tell my parents good news.

67
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,305
I have one school left.

68
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,140
The only good news
I've gotten is that ...

69
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:04,227
my annoying neighbor Becky
is moving back east to Oregon.

70
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,812
Manny, write this down.
I didn't bring a pen.

71
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,899
Election day
is America at its finest.

72
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,234
The people speak
and the government listens.

73
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,785
I don't know
what they do in Colombia.

74
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,282
No one does,
and don't ask.

75
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,285
I mean, we know
that voting's a privilege,

76
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:20,368
but for my daughter to have her name on
that ballot, it just means so much more-

77
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,959
You know what? I think I'm gonna vote later.
What? Where you going?

78
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,881
The line is too long.

79
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,836
It's only three people,
and nobody has a gun.

80
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,670
Eh.

81
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:36,350
We 're here! We 're Claire!
Get used to it!

82
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:40,475
Mmm. You know, I'm not sure if that's tracking.
Here, let me try one.

83
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:43,933
You don't have to be Claire-voyant
to know who to vote for!

84
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,277
Vote Dunphy
for town council.

85
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,229
Uh- Uh-
Uh, Claire Dunphy.

86
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,110
Uh, C-Claire's
her first name.

87
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,567
I'm sorry
if that wasn't Claire.

88
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,195
Oh, my God,
look at that.

89
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:57,871
There's a trash can
right there,

90
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,869
and that guy just threw
his paper on the sidewalk.

91
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:04,454
Hey, you in the yellow jacket. Pick
it up and put it in the trash.

92
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,173
Oh-
Sorry!

93
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,964
Oh, my God, he did it.
Yes, he did.

94
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,295
Ooh, here,
let me try one.

95
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,801
Hey, dragon tattoo!
No jaywalking!

96
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,642
Oh, my gosh, this is
an instrument of power.

97
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,105
How could they not sell tacos? You
know what we could do with this thing?

98
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,683
Cam, we could really
make a difference.

99
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,518
We could be
the voice of change.

100
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,023
Ooh, I got it.

101
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,197
Let's go yell at the dry cleaner
that lost my shirt.

102
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,195
Come on, gang.

103
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,778
Today is the Dunphys
at their best.

104
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,614
- Hi.
- Hi.

105
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,074
- Hey.
- I'm from the Weekly Saver.

106
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,125
Mind if I ask you a couple
questions about the big election?

107
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,703
Not at all.
Fire away.

108
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,538
Who are you
voting for today?

109
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,707
Claire Dunphy.

110
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,758
Finally. I've been waiting
for someone to say that name.

111
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:55,345
Why?
Because I am Claire Dunphy.

112
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,717
Oh. I'm sorry.

113
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,175
They moved me over from ad sales.
We take turns reporting.

114
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,134
How do you feel
about your chances today?

115
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,229
Not as good as I did a few minutes ago.
No, she feels great.

116
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,853
Urn, her spirits are high.
The whole family's high.

117
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,980
There's your headline.
Phil-

118
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,936
- How about a photo of all of you?
- Sure. Yes. Yes.

119
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,109
Mom. Mom, Mom. Tag. Oh, my goodness.
Thank you.

120
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:15,907
That would have been
a really awkward picture.

121
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,325
Okay.

122
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,199
Oh!

123
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,076
What is that? Is that a tooth?

124
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,824
Ewww!
Awesome!

125
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,667
How old are you?
Do it again.

126
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,962
- How does that even happen?
- It's a fake tooth from an old ice skating injury.

127
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,210
It just fell out. Oh, my gosh.
Why today?

128
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,712
Let's not overreact.
Let me see it.

129
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,669
Okay.
All right.

130
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,467
Oww!

131
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,719
Got it. Thanks.

132
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,974
- What happened back there?
- The line was too long. I couldn't wait.

133
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:52,061
I've seen you wait 45 minutes
in line for sherbet.

134
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,111
Well, I happen
to like sherbet, okay?

135
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,031
That place I take you has the
greatest sherbet on the West Coast.

136
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,405
They got lime sherbet,
they got coconut sherbet.

137
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,952
Why are we talking
about sherbet?

138
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,405
- He's clearly changing the subject.
- Why aren't you in school?

139
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,990
He's doing it again.

140
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,246
Manny's right.
You're being very ardilla.

141
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,290
Ardilla?
Yeah, you know.

142
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,747
- The- The one th-that-
- Rabbit. I was being "rabbity."

143
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,299
- No, the one with the cheeks and tail and-
- Chipmunk.

144
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,672
- Possum.
- Okay, obviously she means squirrel.

145
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:20,551
- You were being squirrelly then, you're being
squirrelly now. -Better than bein' a rat.

146
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,174
Manny, give us a minute.
Oh, sure.

147
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,555
I served him up
on a silver platter.

148
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,144
What?

149
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,022
All right,
it's no big deal.

150
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:36,355
There was a woman working there.
I didn't want her to see me.

151
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,190
- Who is she?
- Her name is Dottie.

152
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:42,323
- She's the first woman I dated after my divorce.
- You dated a Dottie after Dede?

153
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:46,032
You're focusing on the wrong thing here.
The point is, it ended badly.

154
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:50,460
I tried to let her down easy, but,
uh, she didn't take it too well.

155
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,539
Actually, I don't know how she
took it 'cause I wasn't there.

156
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:57,126
We dated a few weeks,
then after we, you know-

157
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,508
I slipped out of her house before she
woke up and never called her again.

158
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,931
Put my pants on in her yard,
put the car in neutral,

159
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:04,929
let it roll down the driveway,
lights off.

160
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,477
Hey, I can't talk
about this anymore.

161
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:11,022
So because of this woman, you
didn't vote for your daughter?

162
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,350
It's Claire.
We need her to win.

163
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,277
I don't want to be around when
something that tight comes unraveled.

164
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:19,277
I'll figure out something. Maybe
those poll workers take shifts.

165
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:23,736
Stop hiding in your little cave
like a- like, you know, like the-

166
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,536
the- the-

167
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,873
I really don't want to do this again.
No, th-the big one.

168
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,208
Like the monster furry one.

169
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:33,545
Why can't I remember any animal names?

170
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,341
Climb aboard
the Dunphy Express.

171
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,837
Next stop, democracy.

172
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,336
What? No, no.
Please don't go.

173
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,170
I won't do that anymore.
I promise.

174
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:45,052
Oh. Uh, we need to
make a quick stop.

175
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,676
I gotta pick up my new glasses.
No can do.

176
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,603
I, uh- I got a lot
of people waiting, so-

177
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,226
it'll just take
two minutes.

178
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,309
I can't even see the ballot
without my glasses.

179
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:59,522
I mark the wrong box, next thing you
know, I'll be married to a guy.

180
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,732
Yeah, I-l don't think
it's mandatory, Walt.

181
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:05,115
I'm a good dancer.
They'll come for me.

182
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:10,703
They will break all your buttons and
say you brought it in that way!

183
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,326
Okay, go, go, go!

184
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:15,162
Turns out we had
a lot of axes to grind.

185
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,998
And a hybrid, so there was
virtually no stopping us.

186
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:22,837
Do not see that movie.
You will neither laugh nor cry.

187
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,173
Best pizza in the city? Not
even the best' pizza on the street.

188
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,805
They do not do the hair of the
people on those pictures.

189
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:33,229
Totally ?ee checking ?
Don't bank on it.

190
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:36,774
Okay, that was really fun, but now we
gotta go back to campaigning for Claire.

191
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:40,145
We've been saying that for two hours.
Yes, but now I really mean it.

192
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,356
- Oh, my God, there's Sandy.
- Sandra Bullock?

193
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:46,364
Yes, Sandra Bullock. We're such
good friends, I call her Sandy, so-

194
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,703
No, Sandy who works at Lily's preschool.
Oh, yeah.

195
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,198
You know, she got engaged. No!

196
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,915
To the gay boyfriend?
Totally.

197
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,914
Oh, how
does she not see it?

198
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,333
If I was with somebody that gorgeous,
I'd overlook a few quirks too.

199
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,880
First of all, thank you.

200
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,834
Second of all,
point well taken.

201
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,839
Mmm, poor Sandy.
I feel so bad for her.

202
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,137
It's better than being alone.
Is it?

203
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,759
She's looking over here.

204
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,512
Oh, my God.
Mitchell you're sitting on the button.

205
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,093
No. No, I'm not.
No, I'm not!

206
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,224
It's stuck! And you're the
one that had it last,

207
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,472
when you were taunting the cheese shop.
Oh, please. You know what?

208
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,649
If you advertise truffle cheese,
there are certain expectations.

209
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,442
Hi, Sandy.

210
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,484
I'm calling on behalf
of Claire Dunphy.

211
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,066
Sure. Yeah. Uh-huh. Okay, whatever.
What a beautiful name.

212
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,277
I'm calling on behalf of Claire
Dunphy for town council.

213
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,032
All right,
how about this?

214
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,533
If you vote
for Claire Dunphy,

215
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:34,708
you won't have to pay taxes
for the rest of your life.

216
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:37,206
Vote for Claire.

217
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:40,004
Luke, what are you doing?
You can't say that.

218
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,880
Oh, like she'd be the first politician
to make a promise she can't keep.

219
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,381
Well, maybe I don't want
to talk to you either.

220
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:50,182
Maybe you are the one that is bothering me!
How do you like that, huh?

221
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,556
Gloria, I'm going to
have to ask you again ...

222
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,763
to please
stick to your script.

223
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,644
But everybody's saying no to me.
I don't get it.

224
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,727
Usually, when I ask someone
to do something, they just do it.

225
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,154
Maybe it's because
these people can't see you.

226
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:08,780
I don't like it. Can't you just
hook me up to some sort of camera?

227
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,781
Uh-huh. Thank you,
Maggie, for the vote.

228
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,454
Okay. Bye-DY'?-

229
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:15,911
Here's your seat.

230
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,334
Thank you.
Um, you have to excuse me.

231
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:21,253
I'm a little nervous. I've never
been on the radio before.

232
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,706
Don't worry about it.

233
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,504
Just think of it as a conversation.
Okay.

234
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:28,303
Here are your headphones. Volume control.
Don't get too far from the mic.

235
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,296
Okay. Make sure your
cell phone's off.

236
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,425
Oh, cell phone, right. And
you're not chewing gum, are you?

237
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:37,012
No, I'm not. I just had some
temporary dental work done.

238
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,597
The last thing-
Ohh!

239
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:44,398
And welcome back to A Matter Of Record.
I'm Cecil Van Gundy.

240
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,813
Joining us now
in studio ...

241
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:51,777
is District 43 town council
candidate Claire Dunphy.

242
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,654
Thank you, Cecil.

243
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,532
It's a pleasure
to be here.

244
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,789
So, you're a first-time candidate.
Tell us what got you involved.

245
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:04,874
It all started with
a, um- a stop sign.

246
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:08,711
I was concerned about safety
in our neighborhood ...

247
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:12,969
and I was not getting any
satisfaction from city hall.

248
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,765
What's wrong
with Mom?

249
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,343
Oh, this isn't good.

250
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,890
She sounds drunk.
That's not her drunk voice.

251
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,974
And tell us about some of the
other issues facing our town.

252
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:26,653
Where do you stand on the city's
sewage and sustainability initiative?

253
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,571
The so-called S.S.I.

254
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,569
One cannot really talk about ...

255
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,992
s-s-sewage and sustainability ...

256
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:36,071
without first discussing recycling.

257
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,370
This city can do more with its recycling program.
What the hell's wrong with her?

258
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,872
- She sounds drunk.
- It's a tooth thing.

259
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,578
Uh-oh.

260
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,172
What's wrong? I'm almost out of air.
Oh, boy.

261
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:49,342
- Is it serious?
- ls oxygen serious?

262
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,091
You know what? I lost a ton
of time getting your glasses.

263
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,720
I'm gonna drop you at home. You can get
your air, I can drive other people.

264
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,516
I don't have
any more tanks at home.

265
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,515
Why? That seems like
bad planning.

266
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,517
Well, I forgot
to order them.

267
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,724
My pills
make me forget things.

268
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,729
Oh, shoot!
I gotta take my pill!

269
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,103
Please tell me you have it with you.
Of course I do.

270
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:10,188
But I have to take it
with food. Don't I?

271
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:13,658
Are you asking me? Uh, yes.
I do take them with food.

272
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,280
I don't feel so well.

273
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,283
Okay, I'll get you
whatever you want.

274
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,285
I'll get you the air!
I'll get you the food!

275
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,207
Then I'll vote for
your drunk wife.

276
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,535
That is not
her drunk voice!

277
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:26,371
Thank you so much
for voting.

278
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,832
Thanks so much.
We appreciate it.

279
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:34,046
Hi. I'm terribly sorry. Excuse me.
Jay Pritchett.

280
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,130
Uh, can I get in and out really quick?
Thank you.

281
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,975
Wait, no. You have- Sir! This is all I need.
Thank you very much.

282
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,303
All right.
Claire, Claire, Claire.

283
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,139
Claire, Claire-
Aha! Here!

284
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,895
Oh!

285
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,148
- Hey!
- Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

286
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,651
Hello, Dottie!

287
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,239
Jay!

288
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,036
It's so nice to see you.

289
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,247
Is it? Oh, why wouldn't it be?

290
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:02,741
Well-
Oh.

291
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,794
That was a long time ago. Water
under the bridge. We're good.

292
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:09,418
- Oh, that's great.
- Thank you so much for voting.

293
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,124
You remember
my daughter, Claire.

294
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,084
She's- She's running
for town council.

295
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,304
Oh, isn't that neat?
Yeah, so proud.

296
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,470
So, you're gonna
put it in there, huh?

297
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,802
Oh, yeah, of course. Definitely.

298
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,807
'Cause every vote counts,
you know.

299
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,435
Thank you so much
for voting.

300
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,606
Yeah.

301
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,400
Boy, I'd sure
like to see ...

302
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,978
the sweet sight
of my vote counting.

303
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,649
Why would I say I'd do
something and not do it?

304
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,359
That would make me a liar,

305
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,820
instead of a trusting
widow who fell asleep ...

306
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,826
in the warm embrace of a man
who promised to make breakfast.

307
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,203
Okay, there it is.

308
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:47,331
Look, I'm so sorry.

309
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:52,007
You were the first woman I'd been
with besides my ex in 35 years.

310
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,833
I panicked.

311
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,341
A-A-And it wasn't 'cause you weren't
pretty naked or anything like that.

312
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,172
I'd have run
from Angie Dickinson.

313
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,507
Lucky her.
Dottie-

314
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,008
Good-bye, Jay.
Dottie, Dottie.

315
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,264
Please. I'm just tryin'
to get my ballot in the box.

316
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,142
Oh, yeah!
That sounds familiar.

317
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,643
You don't have to do anything.
Just let me put it in.

318
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:10,566
Shouldn't have said that.

319
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,523
We are so sorry.

320
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:16,732
We did not mean for you
to hear any of that.

321
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,283
Yes. And we shouldn't have been
gossiping in the first place.

322
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,158
What if you're right?
What if Gregory is gay?

323
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,910
When my mom said it, I didn't believe her.
She lives in Iowa.

324
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:28,786
But coming from you two- Means nothing.
We barely know your fiancé.

325
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,667
If he says he's straight,
he's straight.

326
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:34,625
We're getting married in a month.
People are flying in.

327
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,176
He signed us up for dance
classes- Oh, my God.

328
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,719
No. No, no, no.
Hey.

329
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,305
This is what gays do. We gossip.
Yeah. We gossip a lot.

330
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:45,052
He gossips! No, no. You're
missing the point. Okay?

331
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,727
We see a great-looking
guy like Gregory,

332
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,352
and we say he's gay because
we want him to be gay.

333
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,395
Really? Really? Are you sure?
Yes.

334
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,943
Absolutely. Look at what
we do with movie stars.

335
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:57,067
You know? Hugh Jackman.
He sings, he dances, he's dreamy.

336
00:14:57,188 --> 00:15:00,237
So obviously we would want him on our team.
Mmm!

337
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,989
But he's straight.

338
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,991
Trust me. I know.

339
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,993
I said hello to him once
in a restaurant,

340
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,916
and there was absolutely
no chemistry.

341
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,831
Well, if that isn't proof-

342
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,083
Three weeks later, Sandy
and Gregory got married,

343
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,256
and everyone said the
wedding was beautiful.

344
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,958
Gregory did the flowers.

345
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,678
Which is perfectly normal
for a straight guy.

346
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:26,601
The Greeks do one thing
right, and it's lamb.

347
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,519
All right, let's go vote.

348
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,640
Why the hell does your wife want to be
a politician anyway? You heard her.

349
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:35,067
She wanted to put up a stop sign at Bristol
and Greenleaf, but then she ran into-

350
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,362
Wait, wait, wait.
That's near where I live.

351
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,155
Yeah! We're neighbors.
Let's go.

352
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,905
No way I'm votin' for that.
Too much government already.

353
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:47,660
I didn't fight a war so some politician
can tell me where I have to stop my car.

354
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,490
You don't even drive!

355
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:52,043
That's 'cause that Barack Obama
took my license away.

356
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,837
I don't think he was involved
in the decision!

357
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:58,257
I left the house today to get 50 votes for my wife.
I'm not going home with zero.

358
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:01,802
The least you can do is walk right in
there and punch a hole for the woman ...

359
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,802
who drags your garbage can
up your driveway every Tuesday!

360
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:07,680
I don't like it.
Goes against everything I believe in.

361
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,511
- Really? A stop sign?
- But I'll do it.

362
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:14,441
'Cause you're a good kid,
and I had a nice day.

363
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,688
Till you started yelling at me.

364
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,486
So sorry.
Thank you.

365
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:20,939
Here you go.

366
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,866
You know, my wife
was an alcoholic too.

367
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,614
Okay.
Let's just go vote.

368
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:29,163
The polls are closed
for the District 43 town council race-

369
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,911
Hi, everyone!

370
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,501
Any news?
Not yet, not yet.

371
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:38,172
But even if I lose, at least now
I know I have a future in radio.

372
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,966
I couldn't.
People need to see me.

373
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:42,965
Before we hear the results,

374
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:46,924
I just want to thank you all for
everything you've done for me.

375
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,929
Mitch and Cam,

376
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,353
for campaigning for me all day
in your little Claire-mobile.

377
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,476
It's the least
we could do.

378
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,148
Literally.

379
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:59,398
We probably did more for Hugh Jackman's
career than we did for Claire's.

380
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:04,324
And Manny and Gloria, thank you
for making all those phone calls.

381
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,242
And Dad,
for all your support.

382
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:10,117
I don't think I convinced
anyone to vote for Claire.

383
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,914
I don't think I even voted.

384
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,117
And my husband.

385
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:21,584
Who drove around I don't know how many
senior citizens today to the polls.

386
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,508
One.

387
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,586
And my beautiful children,

388
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:30,301
whose faith has given me the confidence
to believe that I can do this.

389
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,722
I can- Oh!
Somebody else answer it.

390
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,720
It's- I lost. I can feel it.
Mom. Mom.

391
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,898
Answer the phone.

392
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,396
Hello.

393
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:42,103
This is she.

394
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,063
Mm-hmm.

395
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,696
Thanks so much for calling.
Bye-bye.

396
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,164
I have some bad news.

397
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:58,461
Because someone's gonna be busy
now that she's a councilwoman?

398
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:01,047
No, no, no!

399
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:03,545
No, I wasn't doing that fake thing.
I really lost. I lost.

400
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,503
Ay, no.

401
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,385
- That's all right.
- I'm so sorry.

402
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,431
But you know what?

403
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,602
We are still
just so proud of you.

404
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,105
Yeah.

405
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,151
I don't know about you, but, um,
I could use a glass of wine.

406
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:27,861
Now you're gonna
hear her drunk voice.

407
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,778
Hmm.

408
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,075
Mom.
Mmm?

409
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:37,034
- You okay?
- Yes, fine. I'm good. I'm fine.

410
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,835
I'm not fine.
I wanted to win, and-

411
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,583
and I'm so embarrassed.

412
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,968
Everybody out there
worked so hard for me ...

413
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,920
and they believed in me,

414
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,471
and I let 'em down.

415
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:56,682
Oh! Honey.
Oh, sweetheart.

416
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,855
Well, don't cry.

417
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,689
I'm gonna be fine, sweetie.

418
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,608
Really, I am.

419
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,482
Just knowing you care
so much makes me feel better.

420
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,188
No.

421
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:10,571
I got four rejection letters
I never told you guys about.

422
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,780
What?

423
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:18,241
I got rejected from UCSB,
Oregon, Wisconsin-

424
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,788
Oh, no.
Northwestern.

425
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,837
Well, we were overshooting
on that one.

426
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,001
What about, uh-
Came today.

427
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,251
My last chance.
Mm-hmm.

428
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,632
I'm too scared
to open it.

429
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:35,933
Whatever it says in there, your father
and I are crazy proud of you. Okay?

430
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,974
I did start trying this year.
I know you did.

431
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,727
You did. You have nothing
to be ashamed of.

432
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,559
Neither do you.

433
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,066
Mmm.
It's a little bit different.

434
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:51,319
No, it's exactly
the same.

435
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:55,700
Except you tried really hard the
whole time, not just at the end.

436
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,783
You're right.
It is the same.

437
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,084
We have nothing to be ashamed of.

438
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,787
So let's open that together.

439
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,214
Yeah, open it.
What? No.

440
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:10,384
- What are you doing here?
- No, come on, Haley. We believe in you.

441
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,674
Do it!  You
can always work for me.

442
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,843
You can do it.
Come on, Haley.

443
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,425
All right, open,
open, open, open.

444
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,895
"Dear Ms. Dunphy,
we regret to inform you-"

445
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,517
Oh, honey.
Mm-hmm.

446
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,399
"While we cannot offer you
admission at this time,

447
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,948
you are a promising candidate, and therefore
we would like to place you on our wait list."

448
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,151
Oh, my God,
I got wait-listed!

449
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,612
We will take it!

450
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,240
Haley!
Congratulations!

451
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,495
Our daughter might be
going to college!

452
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,632
Phil! Look!

453
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:55,638
- A stop sign.
- It's addressed to you.

454
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,553
"Dear Claire,
I won, you lost.

455
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,980
Here is your stupid
stop sign.

456
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:08,605
Next time you think about bothering
me, please take its advice.

457
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,028
Your councilman,
the Honorable Duane Bailey."

458
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,447
- Blaaah!
- Honey, you did it!

459
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:17,322
I did it. I made our
neighborhood a little bit safer.

460
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,654
I may even have saved a life.

461
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:25,334
You idiot! There's a stop sign!
Can't you read?

462
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,166
We need speed bumps.
No.

463
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,168
Mmm. No. No! Honey!

464
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,045
English - US - PSDH
