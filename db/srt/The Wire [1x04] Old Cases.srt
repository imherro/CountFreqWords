1
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:21,781
Fuck me.

2
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:24,215
I'm dying here.

3
00:00:24,323 --> 00:00:27,451
Let me get on the other side,
work it from there.

4
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:30,760
One, two.

5
00:00:30,863 --> 00:00:31,989
-Three.
-Three.

6
00:00:43,075 --> 00:00:44,133
Shit.

7
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,709
Need help?

8
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:55,787
Right. On three, motherfuckers.
One, two, three.

9
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,691
I'm embarrassed for you all.

10
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:12,261
Yo, Herc, I catch my breath,
I'm gonna shoot the drawers off this bitch.

11
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:14,396
It's caught on something, Lieutenant.

12
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,266
Get over there with Carver.

13
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:30,287
One, two, you know what to do.

14
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,690
What the fuck?

15
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,667
Jesus. My ass is kicked.

16
00:01:50,843 --> 00:01:54,973
I could move it a bit when I was alone.
It must've got wedged in the door somehow.

17
00:01:55,114 --> 00:01:56,342
Desk is empty, right?

18
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:58,617
-Yeah.
-You checked it?

19
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,753
At this rate, we're never gonna get it in.

20
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:11,221
What?

21
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,056
In?

22
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,524
In.

23
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:20,272
Unbelievable, unbe-fucking-lievable.

24
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:23,968
Christ.

25
00:04:16,722 --> 00:04:18,690
This case is a bit humble for you.

26
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,856
I know it doesn't look like much on paper,
but see what you can do.

27
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:33,365
-Making new friends?
-Not yet.

28
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,108
I spent the morning down in juvenile court...

29
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:40,337
but the kids know they can't be hurt
with a street-weight charge...

30
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,073
so didn't get much there.

31
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,170
You tried?

32
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:47,084
Nothing like being told,
"Fuck off," by a 14-year-old.

33
00:04:47,853 --> 00:04:49,980
-Right here's our best shot.
-Him?

34
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:55,192
Hand-to-hand with Bubbles,
and he's carrying a long-ass sheet.

35
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:58,889
All right. Who's first? Ms. Dawkins?

36
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:01,156
State versus Marvin Browning, Your Honor.

37
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:04,461
One count distribution of a controlled
substance, to wit, heroin...

38
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,869
and one count distribution of a controlled
substance, to wit, cocaine.

39
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,032
-Quantity?
-One gelcap and one vial, Your Honor.

40
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,875
Bail recommendation?

41
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:16,846
State requests defendant be held,
as he is part of a continuing investigation...

42
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:20,146
and further, is subject to a mandatory
five years without parole...

43
00:05:20,252 --> 00:05:21,583
because of prior convictions.

44
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:24,520
Will your office be seeking
the mandatory five in this case?

45
00:05:24,623 --> 00:05:25,988
Absolutely, Your Honor.

46
00:05:27,426 --> 00:05:30,156
Very well, I'll take that into consideration.

47
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,757
Got his attention, at least.

48
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,641
Lieutenant, come have a taste.

49
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,107
Come on, we're celebrating.

50
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:48,779
Patrick's going out on medical.

51
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:52,840
Sweet, sweet Cervical 6.

52
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:56,646
My shoulder's numb, my arm's numb.

53
00:05:56,822 --> 00:06:00,588
My fingers feel like they belong to
some son of a bitch in the next county.

54
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:04,151
This is my ticket out of
this rat-shit department.

55
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:08,097
66 2l3% pension,
and I don't have to wait for my 30.

56
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,896
-I'm gone.
-Fucking yo did you a favor.

57
00:06:11,103 --> 00:06:12,832
Kid hit like a mule, I've got to say.

58
00:06:12,938 --> 00:06:16,396
You should take a couple of days.
Think it over before you put in papers.

59
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,375
My brother-in-law's got
a video store out on Moravia.

60
00:06:20,045 --> 00:06:24,379
Does $6,000 a week straight rentals,
another $8,000 in porn.

61
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:25,806
He needs a partner.

62
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:28,284
But they take that off
the top of a medical pension.

63
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:31,686
If you report it as income, they do.
Do I look that fucking stupid?

64
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:34,654
Have a nice life, Lieutenant.

65
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:47,596
What's with you?

66
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,074
You gonna miss me, Augs?

67
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:53,103
What the fuck am I going to do, Paddy?

68
00:06:53,445 --> 00:06:54,878
Tell you what.

69
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:58,508
-What do you say we go out together?
-What do you mean?

70
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:02,883
I mean, it only hurts for a minute.
And it doesn't have to be line-of-duty either.

71
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:06,680
I'm serious. You know those stairs where
they send us down to the basement?

72
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:08,623
-Yeah.
-It's dark down there.

73
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:13,254
You go up eight or nine steps,
let go of the rail, take a little jump--

74
00:07:13,365 --> 00:07:16,994
-I'd break my fucking neck like that.
-You don't break nothing.

75
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:21,533
You do a little dance on those steps,
you're up to two-thirds with me.

76
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:24,475
And maybe you sue the city,
get a little more.

77
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,675
Can't say we don't deserve it.

78
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,444
Five in. For a one-and-one.

79
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,352
Now, why bang me like that
for a one-and-one?

80
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:40,892
Because it's your turn, Mr. Browning.
Everybody out there gets a turn.

81
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:43,994
You're all running wild here.
I think a judge might want to...

82
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:46,291
take a look at this
and slow you all down a mite.

83
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:50,163
I don't know, Marvin.
I'm looking at your sheet here, and...

84
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:54,338
for one thing, it's a little wrong
to be calling it a sheet.

85
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,135
More like a book.

86
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,870
Point is, we got the room
to get a little crazy on you.

87
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,707
Like she said, it's your turn.

88
00:08:01,213 --> 00:08:04,614
Tell us some stories,
it could be somebody else's turn.

89
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:07,947
Stories.

90
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:09,915
Avon Barksdale.

91
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:13,313
Know the name?

92
00:08:13,425 --> 00:08:16,223
Every motherfucker up in them towers
knows the name.

93
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:18,853
Myself, I ain't never really
had a word with the man.

94
00:08:18,964 --> 00:08:20,522
Stringer Bell, then?

95
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,493
Wee-Bey? Savino?
Stinkum? C.C.O.? Roc-Roc?

96
00:08:26,972 --> 00:08:29,031
Who're you gonna give us, Marvin?

97
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:32,909
You don't say a name soon,
you're gonna be courtside.

98
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,506
All right.

99
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:37,076
All right, what?

100
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,774
All right, I'll take the years.

101
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:54,160
Damn, boy.

102
00:08:56,468 --> 00:08:57,901
You should see the cop.

103
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,770
When you're ready to get up, put that on.

104
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:04,999
-Report to bunk A-7.
-A-7.

105
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:07,144
Don't be later than breakfast.

106
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:14,319
Who else is up in here?
Anybody from Westside?

107
00:09:14,586 --> 00:09:17,054
D.C. boys, mostly.

108
00:10:48,213 --> 00:10:51,842
Long fucking drive.
Me and you drawing another shit detail.

109
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:54,752
-This ain't a shit detail.
-No?

110
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:59,047
I'm in Upper fucking Marlboro, Maryland,
and still going south.

111
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,687
Look. Another cow.

112
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:06,863
Use your imagination.

113
00:11:06,965 --> 00:11:10,401
This little shitbird, having already been
whipped good by us once...

114
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:13,504
he sees us, right?
And he starts crying like a little bitch...

115
00:11:13,605 --> 00:11:16,403
because he knows we drove
all the way to Prince George's...

116
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:17,702
for more of his ass, right?

117
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,940
Imagine we jack him up,
toss him into a small room...

118
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:25,973
and tell him that Detective Mahone
is near dead from the sucker punch.

119
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:29,748
No shit. The drunk old fuck
suddenly slipped into a coma.

120
00:11:29,988 --> 00:11:33,617
And now the Commissioner and
Mrs. Mahone are at his bedside in the ICU.

121
00:11:33,725 --> 00:11:38,162
And we've been ordered to come down here,
rip off his scrotum, put it in a jar...

122
00:11:38,263 --> 00:11:42,165
and drive it back to Baltimore, so it can sit
with the fucking bowling trophies...

123
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:44,201
behind the bar at the FOP Lodge.

124
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:48,396
All right? After which...

125
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,537
fucknuts stops whimpering long enough...

126
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,577
to just start giving people up, whoever.

127
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,874
Stringer Bell. Avon Barksdale.

128
00:11:58,016 --> 00:11:59,643
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

129
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:01,776
Little prick turns on everybody...

130
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:05,653
and we break the case wide open.

131
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:09,054
-Cool.
-Right?

132
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,669
So, from all them hand-to-hands,
nobody flipped?

133
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:32,517
No, that part of town,
Barksdale carries more weight than we do.

134
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:35,143
Just like all these fucking homicides.

135
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:39,587
Witnesses lying, witnesses paid off,
witnesses backing up on their story.

136
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:42,522
-Can you blame them?
-Not really.

137
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:46,222
Every now and then, we visit the projects.
They live there.

138
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,664
-Your man's Dee, right?
-D'Angelo, yeah.

139
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,929
This one's got a Dee as a possible shooter.

140
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:55,530
-This one connects.
-No way.

141
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,642
Yeah? I'm seeing it.

142
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:03,805
-It's Diedre Kresson, one of Keeley's cases.
-Come on, Jay, this is a college girl...

143
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,612
blown up in the kitchen
of an apartment up in Northeast.

144
00:13:06,718 --> 00:13:09,448
How does this match with the rest
of the Westside mopes?

145
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:12,079
-They don't have cars?
-This doesn't match, Jay.

146
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,216
It does. Take a look at your office report.

147
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:17,124
A witness puts her
with a Dee the night she's aced.

148
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:19,697
How many Dees do you think
there are in the system, Jay?

149
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:20,787
As a street name?

150
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:22,628
Let me ask you something, Jimmy.

151
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:25,635
How many case files you got
that you're putting on Barksdale?

152
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,765
-Maybe a dozen.
-A dozen cases.

153
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:31,274
So, how many of those are from our squad?

154
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,769
One. Gerard Bogue.

155
00:13:34,913 --> 00:13:39,009
One case?
Your squad's down a man for weeks, Jimmy.

156
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:42,052
We're gonna be humping your calls,
catching your cases...

157
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:45,954
hopping around like a one-legged pigtown
whore on check day, and for what?

158
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:49,585
So that you can have your big adventure
and solve everybody else's cases?

159
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,663
Is this what I'm hearing?

160
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:53,660
He's got you, Jimmy.

161
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,798
Where's the love, McNulty?
Show me some fucking love.

162
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:02,340
-All right.
-Attaboy. He's my son.

163
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,007
Why don't you just dump
this loser on Santangelo?

164
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:13,277
He's supposed to be down here
helping us, anyway.

165
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:17,845
I would if I could find the fucker.
Must have another job, he's gone so much.

166
00:14:17,956 --> 00:14:21,323
-What does Daniels have to say about that?
-Nothing, I cover for him.

167
00:14:21,426 --> 00:14:24,725
He was out in the wind there
all day yesterday, half the day before.

168
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,264
Man, Keeley really dogged this one.

169
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:31,700
Ain't nothing in here but a 24
and some crime scene photos, and this.

170
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:37,372
"Tywanda called.
N.F.D., no last name, no address.

171
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:41,706
"Claims your victim killed
after being visited by a suspect named Dee."

172
00:14:42,714 --> 00:14:44,511
No further description.

173
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,544
There's a callback number, though.

174
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:48,915
So, call.

175
00:15:08,206 --> 00:15:10,640
The number you have reached
has been disconnected.

176
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,743
Disconnected.

177
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:15,807
"He got you, Jimmy."

178
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:19,012
All right, motherfucker, he got me, too.

179
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:24,248
So, I'm gonna call Verizon,
see if they got a fresh listing.

180
00:15:24,856 --> 00:15:26,448
You happy now, bitch?

181
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:31,057
You sure about that tag, Bubs?

182
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,129
I seen the van.

183
00:15:33,231 --> 00:15:36,496
It cleared the Court
and rolled up Amity toward Lexington.

184
00:15:36,668 --> 00:15:40,035
Plates were reported stolen off a car parked
right here, on this block.

185
00:15:40,238 --> 00:15:43,105
So you're thinking they're from
right around here?

186
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,334
Maybe.

187
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,406
Word in the Towers said
it was Omar and his crew.

188
00:15:47,512 --> 00:15:51,175
-Omar? Who's he?
-You ain't know Omar?

189
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:55,448
Omar, the terror. Been ripping and robbing
out here for years now.

190
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:58,220
-Is he fierce?
-That nigger don't play.

191
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:01,488
-Got a last name?
-Just Omar.

192
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:03,584
He don't need no last name.

193
00:16:03,695 --> 00:16:05,094
Who's his family?

194
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:08,633
You remember No-Heart Anthony?
Came up with him, they brothers.

195
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,759
No-Heart Anthony?

196
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:15,295
Miss Kima, do not tell me
you don't remember No-Heart Anthony.

197
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:20,438
Damn, girl. What town you been policing at
all these years?

198
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:24,345
And right now, I am personally
ashamed to be your snitch.

199
00:16:28,353 --> 00:16:29,684
-Shit.
-What?

200
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:32,512
-I'm late for my class.
-Class?

201
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,223
-1 2-14.
-12-14?

202
00:16:36,928 --> 00:16:40,056
Requesting anyone in my unit who's up
to report to Channel 13.

203
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:42,766
35, I got that.

204
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,136
Package be moving.

205
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,371
Avon's stuff always be good.

206
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,042
It's a sweet score?

207
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:58,773
It's all right.

208
00:16:59,484 --> 00:17:02,317
That play was a little bit
raggedy in there, though.

209
00:17:03,121 --> 00:17:07,251
I fucked up, I know, letting go your name.

210
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,952
I don't really care you shouted me out.

211
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,993
Everybody in these projects
been knowing Omar, you heard?

212
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,199
I just don't want them
coming down on you, baby-boy.

213
00:17:23,074 --> 00:17:24,974
Shirley coming with her game.

214
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,980
-Every fucking day with that shit.
-Mr. Omar?

215
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:32,246
My check late.

216
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,735
Yo, Mike. Hook a sister up, yo.

217
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:01,303
So, what next, yo?

218
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:03,505
Got some iron.

219
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:06,982
Thinking about working
the flush-and-run over on the Eastside...

220
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,786
till things cool a mite.

221
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:09,979
That'll work.

222
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:15,121
-So you don't want to lay over here tonight?
-No.

223
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,925
-Sure?
-No, I'm gonna go see my mom.

224
00:18:19,931 --> 00:18:23,389
-Keep it close.
-I hear that.

225
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,945
Who the man?

226
00:18:49,594 --> 00:18:52,654
I gotta be somewhere first,
but I'll run him back downtown after.

227
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,756
No problem, thanks for answering.

228
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,803
-Bubbs.
-McNulty.

229
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:05,706
What's up?

230
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:09,177
You ever heard of No-Heart Anthony?

231
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:14,985
Who, Anthony Little?
1058 Argyle, Apartment 16-J.

232
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:18,551
He's up in Hagerstown on a robbery bit.
What about him?

233
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,782
My man.

234
00:19:23,194 --> 00:19:24,354
Fuck y'all.

235
00:19:27,532 --> 00:19:31,263
You know how the cracker motherfuckers do
when they kill a deer?

236
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,165
Or, like, when they go out
killing animals and whatnot?

237
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,000
Got them on the front of the truck...

238
00:19:36,107 --> 00:19:39,804
tied up, stretched out,
so everybody could see it?

239
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:41,938
You feel me?

240
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:45,111
I'm serious, that's what I want.

241
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,580
I want that motherfucker on display.

242
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,814
I'm gonna send a message
to the courtyard about this motherfucker...

243
00:19:50,922 --> 00:19:52,583
so people know we ain't playing.

244
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:55,022
Yeah, we got people on it.

245
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,790
You tell them it's $1,000 on the bucks...

246
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:59,420
and it's $2,000 on Omar.

247
00:20:00,231 --> 00:20:03,064
-Yeah, Bird's on it.
-Savino, too.

248
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:06,632
You know, Bird jailed
with Omar down the cut, right?

249
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,839
He said he all a faggot.

250
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,238
A faggot? Get the fuck out of here.

251
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:14,039
Yeah, said he had a whole
stable of boys down in Jessup.

252
00:20:14,145 --> 00:20:17,945
This punk motherfucker got even less use
for pussy now that he home.

253
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:20,711
So, he gotta a lotta heart for a cocksucker?

254
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:24,687
Yo, we doubling down
on Sweet Lips, all right?

255
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:27,348
We make it motherfucking $4,000 on him...

256
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:31,057
$6,000 if I get the chance to
holler at him before he get got.

257
00:20:31,162 --> 00:20:33,756
-Say no more.
-Take care of all that.

258
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,396
Stickup come up dead
on the stash one night.

259
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:41,933
-Police jumping out the next.
-Something up at the Pit?

260
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,199
Maybe, yeah.

261
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:49,006
-What's up with my nephew?
-I don't know. He doing good.

262
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:51,514
He making that money out the hole, but...

263
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:54,210
he might have a problem
he don't know about.

264
00:20:57,622 --> 00:20:59,590
I'm on him.

265
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,633
Yo, where in
Leave it to Beaver-land are you taking me?

266
00:21:12,737 --> 00:21:14,068
I'm late for something.

267
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,902
I'll drop you after,
on the way back downtown.

268
00:21:17,842 --> 00:21:19,366
-What you late for?
-Soccer.

269
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:21,736
Suck what?

270
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,092
Get in the goal!

271
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:40,587
Spread it out, spread it out, there you go.

272
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:54,875
First team, fall in!

273
00:21:56,347 --> 00:21:59,908
-Dad!
-Mikey, how are you?

274
00:22:00,518 --> 00:22:03,009
-Who's winning?
-They are, 4-1 .

275
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:04,986
4-1? Who got the goal for you guys?

276
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:08,490
-Ricardo, my assist.
-Assist? That's good.

277
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:13,757
You've got to drink on the breaks, okay?
I don't want you to get dehydrated.

278
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:15,560
-Hi.
-Hey.

279
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:17,834
This is Bubbles.

280
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:21,471
-Hi.
-Second team, come on!

281
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:23,598
-Go on, Mike, go get 'em.
-Bye, Dad.

282
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:31,607
You're late. He thought you weren't
gonna come this time either.

283
00:22:31,716 --> 00:22:33,240
This job, you know this job.

284
00:22:33,651 --> 00:22:36,711
I can't get out here
when he gets off the bus at 4:00.

285
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:40,052
I need more than every other weekend.
He needs me more, so does Sean.

286
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:41,989
I'm not giving up any more weekends.

287
00:22:42,093 --> 00:22:44,493
50-50 split's all my lawyer says
I have to give--

288
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:47,326
It's not 50-50 if I don't
see him all goddamn week.

289
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:50,299
-You see him every day--
-Don't curse at me. My lawyer says--

290
00:22:50,401 --> 00:22:51,891
Fuck your lawyer.

291
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:54,934
Fuck you.

292
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:02,705
-Did you see?
-Yeah, I saw.

293
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:06,250
Come on, you get out.

294
00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:26,063
This good for you?

295
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:34,170
Thin line between heaven and here.

296
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:10,678
How did he know where the stash at?
The knockos don't know, but he do.

297
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,215
Because some nigger's snitching.

298
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:15,218
Man, ain't nobody got to be snitching
for Omar or his boys...

299
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,379
to creep by and see where the stash at.

300
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:20,325
-Damn, Bodie. Fucked that nigger up.
-They stomped his ass.

301
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:22,953
-Damn, Bodie. Fucked that nigger up.
-They stomped his ass.

302
00:24:23,561 --> 00:24:26,029
How he ain't courtside
for banking a knocko?

303
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,690
Boy, how you get home so quick?

304
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,196
-Nigger, what you steal?
-Camry XLE.

305
00:24:35,306 --> 00:24:38,173
You all want a ride?
It's right around the corner.

306
00:24:39,944 --> 00:24:41,741
Man, Boy's Village ain't shit.

307
00:24:41,846 --> 00:24:45,612
I'm just too bad for that off-brand
little-boy bullshit, man.

308
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:47,309
It can't hold me.

309
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,982
What you laughing at? What's so funny?

310
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:56,927
If you was me,
your ass would still be down there.

311
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:01,163
You ever seen a city jail, nigger?

312
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,200
You ever caught a body?

313
00:25:03,701 --> 00:25:05,794
I'm the one who just got home, remember?

314
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:08,338
Eight months over on Eager Street
with a body on me.

315
00:25:08,439 --> 00:25:10,873
-Yeah, you got the one.
-Yeah, the one you know about.

316
00:25:10,975 --> 00:25:13,671
You little motherfuckers need to ask around.

317
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:19,577
Yo, out near the county, right,
on the high end of the Eastside?

318
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:22,779
They got these apartments, out there, right?

319
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:26,520
So there was this little shorty
who used to stay out there.

320
00:25:26,624 --> 00:25:27,921
She was, like....

321
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,362
I ain't seen a female that fine since.

322
00:25:34,565 --> 00:25:36,533
I gotta say, Shorty was right.

323
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,131
You fucked her?

324
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:41,137
No, man, it wasn't like that.

325
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,799
This was a shorty
my uncle was messing with.

326
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:46,609
They was going on at it for a little while...

327
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:50,203
till she find out that my uncle got another
little shorty round the way.

328
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:52,875
More right to say he got a few of them
around the way...

329
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:54,349
know what I'm saying?

330
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,886
So, she goes off the hook,
talking about calling the police...

331
00:25:57,989 --> 00:25:59,718
about shit she ain't supposed to know.

332
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:02,054
-Oh, shit.
-Yeah, you know it.

333
00:26:03,027 --> 00:26:07,225
But see, I got some creep to me,
and my uncle, he know that shit.

334
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:10,725
So they roll me out past her crib.

335
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:15,538
And they show me how she lives
right on the ground floor, first level.

336
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:21,337
I go creeping around the back,
to the back window.

337
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:24,371
I got the .45 on me, the big gun.

338
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:28,411
I walk up to the window and I look in,
and it's dark as shit...

339
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:31,147
because it's 3:00 a.m.,
and you can't see shit.

340
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:34,123
What did you do?

341
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,223
So I pulled out the piece...

342
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:41,457
and I start tapping with the back of it
on the window.

343
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:45,263
And it was quiet, but it was loud enough
so she can hear that shit.

344
00:26:49,907 --> 00:26:53,172
That's what she heard, yo.
Sure enough, she comes out.

345
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:55,376
She's naked and shit.

346
00:26:56,547 --> 00:26:59,038
I don't know why the fuck,
but she has a robe...

347
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:02,642
and as she slipping on her robe,
she turns on the light...

348
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:05,587
and when she does that,
and it's light on the inside...

349
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,749
she can't see shit on the outside.

350
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:10,988
Damn, she naked.

351
00:27:15,366 --> 00:27:18,301
She hears that shit on the window
and she ain't got no choice...

352
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:20,997
but to walk over there and see what it is.

353
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:23,329
She steps up...

354
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:25,768
Iooks out...

355
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:27,367
see where it's coming from.

356
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,944
What happened?

357
00:27:37,488 --> 00:27:38,614
He shot her.

358
00:27:42,693 --> 00:27:46,959
Yo, Dee, if she was all that,
why didn't you fuck her first?

359
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:50,430
-Nigger, you sick, just shut up.
-What? I'm just saying....

360
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:52,526
There is something seriously wrong.

361
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,641
This is ridiculous.

362
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,782
Because a lab freezer goes out
with an electrical short...

363
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:08,681
blood samples in 56 homicides...

364
00:28:09,053 --> 00:28:12,454
15 rapes, are allowed to putrefy.

365
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:16,488
-State's attorney knows?
-The mayor, too.

366
00:28:16,894 --> 00:28:21,263
Most of our trace lab is now 25 years old.

367
00:28:22,066 --> 00:28:24,967
You ever go outside for money?
The non-profits?

368
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:27,137
Such as?

369
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:30,730
The Abell Foundation, for one.
My brother's on the board.

370
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:33,605
If you want me to run it up there for you....

371
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:37,306
-You could swing that?
-Never hurts to ask, does it?

372
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:40,617
It never does, Your Honor.

373
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:43,419
So, in that same spirit...

374
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:46,289
where are we with the Barksdale probe?

375
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:51,150
My other reason for stopping by.

376
00:28:57,668 --> 00:29:00,762
Hand-to-hands and search-and-seizures,
I've heard about these.

377
00:29:00,938 --> 00:29:03,566
Some mid-level players caught up,
as you can see.

378
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:08,145
Look, it's not a knockout blow,
but we sent a clear message.

379
00:29:10,681 --> 00:29:12,649
I don't see Barksdale's name anywhere...

380
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,843
or Bell, or anything about the murders.

381
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:17,412
The casework, it goes towards that.

382
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:18,546
No.

383
00:29:20,591 --> 00:29:23,924
So, we've got work to do, don't we?

384
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,768
Police, open the damn door!

385
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:43,642
-What?
-Open the motherfucking door!

386
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,393
-Upstairs front clear.
-Kitchen's clear.

387
00:29:58,796 --> 00:30:00,320
I'm at the backdoor.

388
00:30:00,731 --> 00:30:04,189
-Anybody pop out here?
-Okay, quiet.

389
00:30:05,102 --> 00:30:06,933
Upstairs rear, clear.

390
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:10,205
I'm gonna beat this bitch
like a red-headed stepchild...

391
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,276
for hiding up in this pisshole.

392
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:15,009
Goddamn creepy crawlers everywhere.

393
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:18,377
Tell Bodie we're on his ass.

394
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,296
I'm sorry for cursing at the door.

395
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,392
I mean, I couldn't see that it was only you.

396
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:41,502
Is it the drugs again?

397
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:45,666
Would you like to sit down?

398
00:30:47,945 --> 00:30:51,711
Preston came to me when my daughter died.

399
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,278
He was four years old.

400
00:30:55,052 --> 00:30:58,818
But even then, I knew he was angry.

401
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:02,921
His mother lived out there, caught up in it.

402
00:31:04,228 --> 00:31:07,857
After a while, you couldn't make her
see nothin' else.

403
00:31:08,532 --> 00:31:10,762
No, man, that wasn't us.

404
00:31:10,901 --> 00:31:13,096
2:30 in the towers?
You guys are crazy, man.

405
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,365
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

406
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,871
So, how you think you gonna carry it?

407
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,002
I'm sorry, ma'am.

408
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:24,205
And I'm sorry for the way
we came through here.

409
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:28,816
If Preston comes past...

410
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,685
give him this...

411
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:35,020
and tell him we need to talk, okay?

412
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:38,254
I'm sorry.

413
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:48,303
What the fuck you doing in there?

414
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:49,395
Talking.

415
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:52,398
-Talking?
-Yeah.

416
00:31:57,648 --> 00:31:59,616
-See you later.
-All right, catch you later.

417
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:00,979
I'm driving.

418
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,437
Yeah?

419
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:31,446
McNulty.

420
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:35,078
Some judge for you.

421
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:41,685
Yeah?

422
00:32:44,328 --> 00:32:45,852
Look, can I call you back?

423
00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:55,734
-Major, sir?
-Yeah.

424
00:32:58,676 --> 00:32:59,973
I've been thinkin'.

425
00:33:00,344 --> 00:33:03,472
It's a clear violation of the general orders,
I know, but....

426
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:13,721
Last night, I'm at home,
I'm sittin' up buck naked.

427
00:33:13,824 --> 00:33:17,885
And I got one hand wrapped around
a cold domestic beer...

428
00:33:18,562 --> 00:33:20,996
and the other wrapped around
my magnificent, flaccid...

429
00:33:21,098 --> 00:33:25,728
four-and-one-half inch wonder,
and I am trying with all my might...

430
00:33:25,836 --> 00:33:29,533
to remember what Leila Kaufman's nipples
looked like...

431
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,235
when her bathing top slipped off
at the Hillendale pool swim party.

432
00:33:34,845 --> 00:33:36,904
-Leila Kaufman?
-Yes, sir.

433
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:38,706
Summer of '72.

434
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:42,575
I got this saucy wench
in my gun-sights, so to speak...

435
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,514
and I am dangerously...

436
00:33:47,758 --> 00:33:50,522
close to engorged...

437
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:54,064
when all of a fuckin' sudden,
out of fuckin' nowhere...

438
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:58,424
fuckin' Detective, fuckin' Jimmy McNulty
pops into my head.

439
00:33:58,903 --> 00:33:59,927
McNulty?

440
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:02,436
Obviously, I gotta open my eyes
and admit to myself...

441
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,939
that my whole night is ruined.

442
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:06,305
At which point, I got nothing to do...

443
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:08,872
but think about the problems
of Jimmy McNulty.

444
00:34:08,979 --> 00:34:11,243
Because, clearly, this guy...

445
00:34:11,415 --> 00:34:15,681
and his fuckin' problems are standing
between me and all worldly pleasure.

446
00:34:15,886 --> 00:34:16,978
Clearly.

447
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:20,722
First of all, it's not Jimmy's fault.

448
00:34:22,426 --> 00:34:23,450
-No?
-No.

449
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:26,095
Jimmy is an addict, sir.

450
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:27,988
What's he addicted to?

451
00:34:28,999 --> 00:34:30,261
Himself.

452
00:34:32,102 --> 00:34:33,763
It's not funny, sir.

453
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:37,068
As a matter of fact,
it's a fuckin' tragedy is what it is.

454
00:34:37,441 --> 00:34:39,636
The guy, he has come to believe...

455
00:34:39,743 --> 00:34:42,439
that he is always the smartest fuck
in the room.

456
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:46,147
And you know what? It's not his fault,
because let's face it...

457
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,878
he's not going to Johns Hopkins
or joining Mensa...

458
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:52,319
he's taking a fuckin' job
with the Baltimore Police Department.

459
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:55,620
His first two years in Homicide,
he's in Ulmansky's squad...

460
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:57,591
partnered with Tony Lamartino.

461
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:01,630
Christ, it must've been months even...

462
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:04,257
he was the smartest fuck
in the fuckin' room.

463
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:05,960
What's your point, Jay?

464
00:35:06,403 --> 00:35:07,870
My point is...

465
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:10,301
he can't help it.

466
00:35:11,675 --> 00:35:14,007
It makes him an asshole, I know...

467
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:17,842
but it's also what makes him good police.

468
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:23,911
Last year, he gives me eight clearances.

469
00:35:25,589 --> 00:35:29,150
One of them was a decomp floater...

470
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:31,293
who was John Doe for three weeks.

471
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:45,633
Tell your boy to wrap up that bullshit detail
in two weeks.

472
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:49,440
He does that, he comes home, clean slate.

473
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:05,123
You would've loved it.

474
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:08,756
Burrell is sittin' across from me
with a handful ofstreet-level arrests...

475
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:10,663
pretendin' he has a plan.

476
00:36:10,834 --> 00:36:12,529
So, what did you tell him?

477
00:36:12,636 --> 00:36:16,094
"Never shit a shitter, Deputy. "
That's what I fuckin' told him.

478
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:20,602
-I did good, right, Jimmy?
-I gotta go.

479
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:34,114
"Discuss the Hicks ruling
as a manifestation...

480
00:36:34,224 --> 00:36:37,625
"of the judiciary's attempt
to maintain a speedy disposition...

481
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:40,959
"of criminal cases within
a modern court system."

482
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:43,125
What?

483
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,858
That's what I said.

484
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,196
"What?"

485
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:49,897
What the hell's the Hicks ruling?

486
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:52,373
Did you highlight my sofa?

487
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:54,235
What? No.

488
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:56,074
Yes, you did.

489
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:58,109
That was there from before.

490
00:36:58,215 --> 00:37:00,979
Hell it was.
Damn, Kima, marker does not come out.

491
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:04,782
-No, I didn't do it, I swear.
-Okay, let me see the marker.

492
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:08,414
You want my marker,
I need to see a warrant.

493
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:11,591
I'm serious, I need to see
some probable cause.

494
00:37:11,695 --> 00:37:14,425
I'm gonna beat your ass.
How about that for probable cause?

495
00:37:14,531 --> 00:37:19,025
-Give me the marker.
-Damn, gettin' all violent and shit.

496
00:37:19,803 --> 00:37:21,896
You know you just violated my civil rights?

497
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:24,065
That's it, new rule: no marker on the couch.

498
00:37:24,174 --> 00:37:26,836
You get over to that table over there
and do your homework.

499
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:29,879
Go. Take it and go.

500
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,777
Gimme my marker.

501
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:47,361
I'm gonna need some club soda.

502
00:37:47,464 --> 00:37:51,833
Damn, girl, this cell phone bill
must eat up the paycheck.

503
00:37:51,935 --> 00:37:54,927
No, most of that's work,
it's on the company.

504
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:05,814
Phelan won't let go.

505
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,812
Are we anywhere close on Barksdale?

506
00:38:09,653 --> 00:38:12,213
-No, sir.
-So, what are you telling me?

507
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:16,084
I'm not telling you anything, sir.
I'm waiting for you to tell me.

508
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:18,722
I can do whatever
you need me to do with this.

509
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:21,354
If you want me to push it further,
I can do that.

510
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,330
If you want it to go away....

511
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:30,099
If you wanna bring in someone else,
maybe do things differently.

512
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:34,677
You looking for the back door, Lieutenant?

513
00:38:35,045 --> 00:38:36,034
Already?

514
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:40,146
McNulty says this case needs a wire.

515
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:42,775
You think he's right?

516
00:38:45,622 --> 00:38:47,351
It needs somethin'.

517
00:38:58,702 --> 00:39:00,294
Just climb your ass up the pole, man.

518
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:03,066
No, man. This'll work.

519
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:07,967
I'm not climbin' no damn ladder.

520
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:13,249
You never gonna hit it, man.

521
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,442
Bomb!

522
00:39:14,651 --> 00:39:17,142
-Housing must think we just dumb.
-Is that--

523
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:19,855
-That's your pager or mine?
-That's me.

524
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:25,759
-Yo, watch that shit on my head.
-Man, it ricocheted off the fuckin' camera.

525
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,990
Yeah, you need some aim.

526
00:39:47,417 --> 00:39:48,941
Yo, who this?

527
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:11,265
So, what do you think?

528
00:40:11,508 --> 00:40:12,702
Title 3?

529
00:40:12,976 --> 00:40:17,379
Right, but it's not for a wiretap.
It's to clone a pager, I got it from Pearlman.

530
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:20,712
-Pagers?
-Some kind of throwback thing.

531
00:40:21,451 --> 00:40:25,012
-You mean, why not cell phones?
-Right. Who uses pagers anymore?

532
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:29,148
Tell you what, I was checking out
a wireless bill last night.

533
00:40:29,459 --> 00:40:31,654
Every incoming call was listed.

534
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:36,130
Right. So, if we get Barksdale's pager,
we might get off the street.

535
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:38,098
Maybe even trace some supply.

536
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:44,607
So, who's No-Heart Anthony?

537
00:40:45,542 --> 00:40:48,238
No-Heart ran drugs in the homes
in the early '90s.

538
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:50,210
So, a couple years back, I don't know why...

539
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:53,841
he finds himself in Randallstown,
tryin' to take off a jewelry store.

540
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:57,478
He fucks it up, half the county
chases him back downtown.

541
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,784
And I guess No-Heart figures
he's not up for doing the time...

542
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:04,258
'cause he puts a .44 against his chest,
pulls the trigger.

543
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:05,623
A .44?

544
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:08,387
It's a contact wound.

545
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:11,663
Wakes up two hours later
in the University ER.

546
00:41:12,035 --> 00:41:14,401
-With a new nickname.
-Right.

547
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,137
Bubbles says it's Anthony's brother...

548
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:21,234
who took off with the Barksdale stash
the other night.

549
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:22,936
Dude named Omar.

550
00:41:23,513 --> 00:41:27,210
It's not the easiest trade, you know,
robbin' dealers.

551
00:41:29,586 --> 00:41:32,282
Man like that is likely to have
a weapon on him.

552
00:41:32,422 --> 00:41:35,152
We jack him up, there's a charge to work off.

553
00:41:35,692 --> 00:41:38,388
And if he knows where
the Barksdale stash is...

554
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:41,223
he probably knows a whole lot more.

555
00:41:41,431 --> 00:41:44,195
See? Another plan.

556
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:03,743
The thing is, we're gonna have to sell this.

557
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,550
You wanna raise it with Daniels?

558
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:08,955
He'll listen to you more than me.

559
00:42:14,731 --> 00:42:16,164
Where's Santangelo?

560
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:19,528
He's at ECU. He's got a case going today.

561
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:25,138
As of today, I haven't heard anything
to the contrary, so...

562
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,738
we're gonna press on.

563
00:42:30,647 --> 00:42:31,739
Ideas?

564
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:35,483
We could continue with the busts.

565
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:40,255
But I don't think that's gonna
get us too far off the street.

566
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:43,588
On the other hand, the people we pulled in
last week had pagers.

567
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:46,686
So did D'Angelo Barksdale
when McNulty jacked him up.

568
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:49,459
We could clone a couple of pagers,
see where that takes us.

569
00:42:49,566 --> 00:42:51,761
-Clone what?
-Their pagers.

570
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:56,405
They get beeped, we get beeped.
We see who's calling, from what number.

571
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,065
If they're all that,
why are they still using pagers?

572
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:01,701
Why not un-ass a few dollars
for cell phones?

573
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:03,710
It's a discipline.

574
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:07,878
You can't bug a pager.

575
00:43:08,952 --> 00:43:11,318
But you can't make a call
with a pager, either.

576
00:43:11,421 --> 00:43:15,084
You're gonna want a pen register
on all the payphones in the low-rises...

577
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:17,717
and any other phones
that link to the pagers.

578
00:43:18,795 --> 00:43:20,524
What would it take to do the pagers?

579
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:22,257
A wiretap affidavit.

580
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:25,526
I think we got enough PC
from the hand-to-hands and surveillance.

581
00:43:25,635 --> 00:43:26,795
We got most of the exhaustion.

582
00:43:26,903 --> 00:43:28,700
I'm exhausted just listening to this shit.

583
00:43:28,805 --> 00:43:33,674
Good. Exhaustion is a legal requirement
for using electronic intercepts.

584
00:43:34,444 --> 00:43:36,241
We gotta prove nothing else works.

585
00:43:36,346 --> 00:43:39,247
See, we did the raids, we made the arrests,
but nobody flipped.

586
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:42,341
We don't have an informant
who takes us anywhere above the street.

587
00:43:42,452 --> 00:43:43,646
That's pretty much exhaustion.

588
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:46,314
All we got left to do now
is follow one of these mopes...

589
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:48,152
and prove to ourselves we can't do it.

590
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:50,351
We try to show a judge we can't make...

591
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,519
the case by following these guys,
and we can't.

592
00:43:52,629 --> 00:43:55,029
How can we keep on any of them
when they're in those towers?

593
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,656
But you gotta show you tried.

594
00:44:01,204 --> 00:44:03,035
Do we have a pager number?

595
00:44:11,648 --> 00:44:14,412
This was written on the stash house wall...

596
00:44:14,684 --> 00:44:16,948
with the letter "D" next to it.

597
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:20,114
Is that D'Angelo? Did you check it?

598
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:22,152
It's him.

599
00:44:36,706 --> 00:44:38,003
Let's do this.

600
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:46,578
What does he want us to do?
I don't understand.

601
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:49,813
I'll explain it to you if you buy me breakfast.

602
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:04,698
Will you explain to me again...

603
00:45:04,801 --> 00:45:07,099
why I'm about to rework
a six-month-old crime scene?

604
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:10,139
Look at this narrow-ass file.
Keeley didn't do shit on this.

605
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,207
He did the scene, though.

606
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:12,775
This is Keeley we're talking about.

607
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,935
Fucking Jay and his leaps of logic.

608
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:17,070
This case is nowhere near
anything we're doing.

609
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:18,943
So? Give it a shake or two anyhow.

610
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,108
-Make a sergeant happy.
-Whatever.

611
00:45:22,185 --> 00:45:23,982
Do you know Lester Freamon?

612
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:26,381
A little. Why?

613
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,549
He's with us on this Barksdale thing.

614
00:45:28,658 --> 00:45:30,319
I thought you said they gave you humps.

615
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:35,126
He looks like a hump, he acts like a hump,
sittin' there, playing with his toy furniture.

616
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:39,127
Jimmy, he makes more money off of
that shit than you do off of this job.

617
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,534
-Don't let Lester fool you.
-He did already.

618
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:43,401
Today in roll call, he showed something.

619
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:45,873
Hey, he's natural police.

620
00:45:46,109 --> 00:45:47,701
He used to be Homicide.

621
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:50,209
-Why did he leave?
-Ask him.

622
00:45:53,416 --> 00:45:56,510
-This is the one?
-Yup. Hasn't been rented since.

623
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:11,300
Fuck.

624
00:46:14,437 --> 00:46:16,371
Motherfucker.

625
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:28,275
Fucking fuck.

626
00:46:30,153 --> 00:46:31,518
Fuck.

627
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,523
Fuck.

628
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:48,660
What the fuck?

629
00:46:56,846 --> 00:46:58,040
Fuck.

630
00:47:05,488 --> 00:47:06,512
Fuck.

631
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:36,881
-No.
-Fuck.

632
00:47:47,063 --> 00:47:48,155
Fuck it.

633
00:47:50,433 --> 00:47:51,559
Fuck.

634
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:00,738
Motherfuck.

635
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,275
Fuck.

636
00:48:22,565 --> 00:48:25,796
Fuckity, fuck, fuck.

637
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:30,897
Fuck.

638
00:48:32,008 --> 00:48:33,066
Fuck.

639
00:48:45,121 --> 00:48:47,112
Motherfucker.

640
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,927
Fuckin' A.

641
00:49:08,511 --> 00:49:09,603
Fuck.

642
00:49:21,624 --> 00:49:22,921
Check this.

643
00:49:23,793 --> 00:49:25,226
Motherfucker.

644
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:29,695
Fuck me.

645
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:45,102
Sydnor's on foot, Carv's in the car...

646
00:50:45,408 --> 00:50:48,844
Herc, you need to be
on top of the roof behind Amity.

647
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:51,507
Again, I get the shit detail?

648
00:50:51,614 --> 00:50:53,605
The plan is to stay on D'Angelo.

649
00:50:53,783 --> 00:50:55,717
If we lose him, we lose him, right?

650
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:57,047
We're gonna lose him.

651
00:50:57,153 --> 00:50:58,745
You can't follow people in the towers.

652
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:01,380
You can't hang in the low-rises
unless you got a reason.

653
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:04,221
Just to make sure,
we want to lose him, right?

654
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:05,885
Losin' him is good?

655
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:07,720
Right.

656
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:09,726
Then why the fuck do this?

657
00:51:10,099 --> 00:51:13,364
Come on, Herc.
Roll with me on this one, all right?

658
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:27,706
So, you're police after all.

659
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:32,354
You know what you doing,
but you ain't been doing it.

660
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:34,283
How long you been in the Pawnshop unit?

661
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:35,823
13 years and four months.

662
00:51:35,925 --> 00:51:37,950
-13 years?
-And four months.

663
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:39,695
I gotta ask you...

664
00:51:40,129 --> 00:51:43,292
what exactly does a police officer assigned
to the Pawnshop unit do?

665
00:51:43,399 --> 00:51:45,458
You intake reports
from registered pawnshops...

666
00:51:45,568 --> 00:51:47,536
on all items valued over $50.

667
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:49,865
Then you make an index card for that item.

668
00:51:49,973 --> 00:51:51,634
Then you file that index card.

669
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:54,642
If someone wants to find out
if something stolen was pawned...

670
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:56,041
we see if we have an index card.

671
00:51:56,145 --> 00:51:57,806
If we do, we do, if we don't, we don't.

672
00:51:57,914 --> 00:52:00,144
-You did that for 13 years?
-And four months.

673
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:01,547
Why'd you ask out of Homicide?

674
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:02,777
Wasn't no ask about it.

675
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:04,217
You got the boot?

676
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:05,649
What'd you do to piss them off?

677
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:06,983
Police work.

678
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:10,890
I think I need to buy you a drink.

679
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:13,388
Just one?

680
00:52:14,797 --> 00:52:18,096
Caught this case in a Brooklyn home
in the summer of '87.

681
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:21,533
80-year-old woman, stabbed up...

682
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:24,573
nightgown, in bed,
forced window, rear entry.

683
00:52:25,508 --> 00:52:26,941
Worked it for a couple of weeks.

684
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:29,637
Got the names of two squirrels
over in Curtis Bay.

685
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:31,111
Squirrel number one gives it up...

686
00:52:31,214 --> 00:52:33,978
and tries to put all the weight
on squirrel number two.

687
00:52:34,083 --> 00:52:35,414
Back up the statements?

688
00:52:35,518 --> 00:52:37,509
Print it on the rear window for number two...

689
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:39,781
another one for number one
on the medicine chest.

690
00:52:39,889 --> 00:52:41,356
So, it's down, yeah?

691
00:52:42,992 --> 00:52:45,790
Even better when squirrel number one
drives it by the house...

692
00:52:45,895 --> 00:52:47,487
where they fenced the old lady's shit:

693
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:49,792
clock-radio, TV, toaster oven.

694
00:52:50,733 --> 00:52:52,325
So, what's the problem?

695
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:54,469
The problem is the fence.

696
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:56,968
Turned out he was the son
of one of the big editors...

697
00:52:57,073 --> 00:52:58,597
over at the News America.

698
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:00,642
This man is running
the afternoon newspaper...

699
00:53:00,743 --> 00:53:02,404
and his son is getting all fucked up...

700
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:05,481
doin' the dirt and getting high
down in Locust Point.

701
00:53:05,915 --> 00:53:08,816
The deputy, who I guess
is in a favor-doin' mood...

702
00:53:08,918 --> 00:53:10,180
sends word down to the major...

703
00:53:10,286 --> 00:53:13,585
I'm supposed to make
the case without the fence.

704
00:53:14,891 --> 00:53:17,689
Just the print hits and the statement.
Play it like that.

705
00:53:17,794 --> 00:53:18,954
So, he's doin' this for what?

706
00:53:19,062 --> 00:53:20,859
To have some newspaper guy in his pocket?

707
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:22,693
Yeah, I guess so.

708
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:26,432
Is this Burrell?

709
00:53:26,769 --> 00:53:29,738
No, no, Mueller. Deputy Ops before Burrell.

710
00:53:30,907 --> 00:53:32,374
So, what did you do?

711
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:34,972
What do you think I did?

712
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:38,939
I charged him with receiving,
then had his ass testify.

713
00:53:39,048 --> 00:53:42,814
You could've made the case without him.
Just on the prints and the statements.

714
00:53:42,919 --> 00:53:44,853
Probably, yup.

715
00:53:46,956 --> 00:53:48,548
Why didn't you?

716
00:53:48,958 --> 00:53:50,289
Why?

717
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:55,656
Why are you fuckin' up yourself
chasing Avon Barksdale?

718
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:02,536
A week after trial ends, Major comes to me...

719
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:04,402
asks me where I want to go.

720
00:54:05,441 --> 00:54:08,535
I tell him, I don't care,
I like to be outside, you know?

721
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:09,805
Give me a goddamn foot-post...

722
00:54:09,912 --> 00:54:11,470
I'll still make my money, you know...

723
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:14,072
send my ass up to Edmondson Avenue,
I don't give a shit.

724
00:54:14,183 --> 00:54:15,445
You went to a foot-post?

725
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:18,520
Major come back,
asks me where I don't want to go.

726
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:22,191
And he asks it like
he wanna make sure I land okay.

727
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:25,926
So, I tell him, I don't want
no fuckin' paper-shuffle.

728
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:27,629
No office shit.

729
00:54:28,064 --> 00:54:30,658
Send my black ass outside
and let me police somewhere.

730
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,166
Pawnshop unit.

731
00:54:33,169 --> 00:54:34,898
They got me good.

732
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:39,368
So, why'd they let you out of the box?
Why now?

733
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,742
I guess they just forgot about me.

734
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:45,943
Shit, Lester.

735
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:49,009
You back from the dead?

736
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:52,050
You rolled away the stone.

737
00:54:52,655 --> 00:54:56,557
Bunk Moreland says you're natural police.
One of the few.

738
00:54:57,827 --> 00:54:59,795
Yeah, I've had my moments.

739
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:04,330
Detective...

740
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:08,668
when they ask you where you wanna go...

741
00:55:09,038 --> 00:55:12,565
and they are gonna ask you
where you wanna go...

742
00:55:12,675 --> 00:55:14,540
do yourself a favor...

743
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:17,479
keep your mouth shut.

744
00:55:20,149 --> 00:55:22,413
I gotta take a tinkle, boy.

745
00:55:23,586 --> 00:55:26,054
-I got it.
-All right.

746
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:41,296
Hello.

747
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:47,237
-Is Kima there?
-And you are?

748
00:55:47,643 --> 00:55:50,305
Tell her it's McNulty.

749
00:56:00,556 --> 00:56:04,492
For you, Kima,
a decidedly confused white boy.

750
00:56:05,094 --> 00:56:06,356
God.

751
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,468
How'd it go today?

752
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,572
Lost him in the 221 .

753
00:56:25,681 --> 00:56:27,546
Picked him back up in the low-rises...

754
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:30,278
and then lost him
on Schroeder Street after dark.

755
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:31,819
Nicely done.

756
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:37,452
-Are you okay to drive?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

757
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,256
I just wanted to thank you.

758
00:56:41,063 --> 00:56:42,052
For what?

759
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:45,066
For today, you know, with Daniels.

760
00:56:46,135 --> 00:56:48,660
-You should be thanking Lester.
-I did.

761
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:52,036
I just wanted to thank you, too,
Detective Greggs.

762
00:56:55,077 --> 00:56:57,875
No problem. Good night.

763
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:59,641
That it is.

764
00:57:09,792 --> 00:57:11,453
What'd I miss?

765
00:57:12,261 --> 00:57:13,694
Nothin' much.

766
00:57:14,197 --> 00:57:15,459
Lovelorn?

767
00:57:15,731 --> 00:57:17,722
Worse. Lonely.

768
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:23,938
You didn't make it into class again today.

769
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:27,899
You said you'd stick with it.

770
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:29,341
I'm tryin'.

771
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:32,180
Things are hot right now.

772
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:35,643
I'm doing the best I can.

773
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:39,315
You said yourself,
you need to do somethin' else.

774
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:41,550
Somethin' better for us.

775
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:44,383
You promised.

776
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:49,587
Man.

777
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:55,500
What am I gonna do with you?

778
00:57:56,772 --> 00:58:01,209
You know better women than you
have fallen for my tricks, right?

779
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,986
What have you got under this?
