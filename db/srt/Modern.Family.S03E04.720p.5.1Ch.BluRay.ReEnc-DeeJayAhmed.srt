1
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:05,130
So then what happened?

2
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:09,264
Well, she didn't show up to school the next day,
and I heard that she slept over at his dorm.

3
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:10,970
No way.
Mm-hmm.

4
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:14,023
Seriously, are you surprised?
Do you not know Carly?

5
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,020
Have you seen
what she wears to school?

6
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:18,022
Girls, let's cool it
on the gossip, okay?

7
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,354
It's not right, and Carly's
got enough problems.

8
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,155
What do you mean?

9
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:25,906
Well, her mom can't get through a soccer
practice without a thermos of Chardonnay,

10
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,702
and don't get me started
on the dad.

11
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:28,745
That guy-

12
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:29,829
Oh!

13
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:31,415
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

14
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:34,206
Mom! Oh, this is such a
dangerous intersection!

15
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,707
Did I get lipstick
on my face?

16
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:38,380
No, you're fine.

17
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:41,629
And consider yourself lucky you didn'tjust
get, like, felt up by your mom.

18
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,378
They need to get a stop sign. What
is your obsession with traffic?

19
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,384
It's an obsession
with safety.

20
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:50,180
One of these days, Joe Speeder is gonna come
tearin' through here, and somebody's gonna-

21
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:52,261
Oh, my God!

22
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,388
I'm okay.
Oh! Oh, my God.

23
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,098
I'm okay. Hey, GUYS-

24
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:57,816
Phil?
Yeah. No, I'm good.

25
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,440
Gotta keep movin'.
Keep the heart rate up.

26
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:02,396
Oh. Okay.

27
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,277
How's my face?

28
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:06,484
- Still good.
- Okay, good.

29
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:15,752
# Hey, hey #

30
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:16,998
# Hey ##

31
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:22,170
Gloria, how many times do I have to tell
you to pull your car all the way in?

32
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,842
The gate was open
all night.

33
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,921
We live in a nice neighborhood.
What are you afraid of?

34
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:31,225
That some money's gonna ?y in, and then
your gardener is gonna have to rake it up?

35
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,515
Jay, I'm going to need you
to cut me a check.

36
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:37,014
What now? Drama club trip.
Les Misérables.

37
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,475
We're selling wrapping paper
to raise money for the tickets.

38
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:42,027
No, no. Wait, wait. Slow down.
What's the story exactly?

39
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,981
Well, Jean Valjean spent 19 years in prison
for stealing a loaf of bread-

40
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,280
The wrapping Paper-

41
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,779
Nineteen years for a loaf of bread?

42
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,486
How good was this bread?

43
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:54,036
It wasn't about the bread. It was about
the society where- Focus, people!

44
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,082
Manny, we'll buy
all your wrapping paper.

45
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:59,002
No, we won't.
No, he's got to learn to sell.

46
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:02,206
This is the best business training there is.
Hell, the best life training.

47
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,791
Manny, write this down.

48
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:07,879
A good salesman goes after
Moby-Dick in a rowboat ...

49
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,931
and brings the tartar sauce
with him.

50
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,885
Jay's always telling
me to "write this down."

51
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,016
I don't always catch everything he says.

52
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:20,725
"Something, something, firm handshake."

53
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,310
"Never take the first room they show you."

54
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,816
I'm not sure who "they" is.

55
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:28,820
And this one just says "pancakes."

56
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:32,119
Cam, what's this scribbled on the
Vanity Fair about an adoption agency?

57
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:35,368
Oh, yeah, they called to say they
wanted to reschedule our home visit.

58
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:37,165
When? Why didn't you tell me?

59
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,742
This is kind of important.

60
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,461
Well, when does it say?
Uh, who knows?

61
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,880
It disappears
into Jennifer Aniston's hair.

62
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,548
You gotta get
a better system.

63
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,797
There is nothing wrong
with my system.

64
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:51,005
Ask me anything about any upcoming event,
and I can tell you when and where it is.

65
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,841
When is
the adoption agency visit?

66
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:56,552
Okay. Is that
a 5 or a curl?

67
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,637
Oh, I hope Jen's
finally found love.

68
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:06,695
What happened here?

69
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,647
Well, Lily and I woke up
in a French mood,

70
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,198
so we decided
to whip up some crepes.

71
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:13,197
When are you gonna be in the
mood to wipe up some crepes?

72
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,153
I know, it's a little messy,
but you know what?

73
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,575
I'm gonna clean it up.
Okay.

74
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:19,078
- I'm gonna clean it up.
- Will you?

75
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,955
- Just say what's on your mind.
- You never clean up.

76
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,170
Save the gasp.

77
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,963
Cam, whenever you get
creative in the kitchen,

78
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,040
I'm the one who ends up
cleaning it up, okay?

79
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:30,173
The homemade pizza. Fondue.
Molecular gastronomy.

80
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,505
I'm still cleaning shrimp foam
out of the curtains.

81
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,010
Okay, you know what, Mitchell?
Just go to work, okay?

82
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,513
I'm gonna take Lily to school
and then when I get home,

83
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,012
I'm gonna scrub this place like
a crime scene.

84
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,063
Which it is,
because you've murdered joy.

85
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,316
Hey, buddy.
What's up?

86
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,817
Hey, Dad. Think fast.

87
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,451
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

88
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,073
Oh, my God!

89
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:58,747
If we had that on tape, it'd be
the greatest YouTube video ever.

90
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,496
We'd get, like, a million hits.
This is our double rainbow!

91
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,373
We need to do it again.

92
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:07,252
Oh, I would, buddy, but, uh, your mom's all
over me to change a bunch of lightbulbs.

93
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,833
How many moms does it take
to screw in a lightbulb?

94
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,426
I don't know.
None.

95
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,254
'Cause they get you to do it, sucker.

96
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,681
Ah!

97
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:21,137
I laughed,
but ... it hurt a little.

98
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,187
We're home.

99
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,606
Us too.

100
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,308
Oh, great.
You're all here.

101
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,984
What's up, girl?
Oh.

102
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,857
You know that really
dangerous intersection?

103
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,236
Where desire meets jealousy,
and the result is murder?

104
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,283
Mm-mmm. The one where I almost
killed you this morning.

105
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,157
Oh, yeah. Sorry. That was my bad.
I got lost in my jams.

106
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:41,490
speed walkin' and Speedwagon.

107
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,826
Oh! I wasn't even
tryin' for that.

108
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,252
Nice.

109
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,955
Well, I am getting us
a stop sign.

110
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,587
I called city hall.
And how is this for amazing?

111
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,417
The traffic committee
meets tonight.

112
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,636
I've got goose bumps.
I know! Right?

113
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:58,636
All I have to do is get 50
signatures, show up, make my case.

114
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,759
It's on.
I am so proud of you.

115
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,560
We all are.
Hmm.

116
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,855
We love when
Mom gets on a project.

117
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,560
Because usually the minute any of us walks
in the door, she gives us something to do.

118
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,482
"Do your homework. Clean
your room." "Put on pants."

119
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,690
Like the queen's comin' over.
Am I right?

120
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:19,574
So when she's not around or gets busy,
Luke and I capitalize on the situation.

121
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,747
There you are,
my good man.

122
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,449
Squire.

123
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,496
Let's do it.
Whoo!

124
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,418
Get ya some!

125
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,121
Well, I think
it's awesome.

126
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:33,084
I'm so glad, because I could really use
your help getting these signatures.

127
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:38,430
I'll do it. Soon as I change
those lightbulbs you wanted.

128
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,098
Great. Kids?

129
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,097
Crud. You know,
I've got a ton of homework.

130
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,850
Uh, science project.

131
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:46,930
Haley?

132
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,358
I need to get started
on my college essay.

133
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,061
You know what? Maybe
I'll write it about you.

134
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:56,114
You're just so inspirational.
Girl power.

135
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,362
- You rock.
- Thanks, honey.

136
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,744
I do rock.

137
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,744
Stella, down.

138
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,494
Stella, no.
This is very dangerous.

139
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,335
Okay, señorita, that's it.

140
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:15,759
Come here, because Jay is gonna be
very mad if something happens to you.

141
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:19,221
A y, tener que cuidar
perra ahora. Oué belleza.

142
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:23,142
Go play with the ball!
See you later.

143
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,970
Now I can cook.
Do my empanada.

144
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,771
The gate. Ay, no.
Ay, no. The gate.

145
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,602
The gate!

146
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,858
Stella, come back!

147
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,956
Hey there, Mr. Salesman.

148
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,000
Can we not talk
about business?

149
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,453
- That bad, huh?
- I gave it everything I got.

150
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,664
Working the dimples,
going big eyes.

151
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,717
It got me two things-
diddly and squat.

152
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,795
- How many houses you hit?
- I don't know.

153
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,218
It must've been at least three.
Three!

154
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,550
And that's your idea
of the best you got?

155
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:07,853
It was very hard on me.
I'm not used to rejection.

156
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,350
Or hills.

157
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,729
Look, you can't quit after three houses.
That's not perseverance.

158
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,310
- What are you sellin'?
- Wrapping paper.

159
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:18,146
Wrong.
You're selling Christmas.

160
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:21,073
The excitement of opening presents.
The taste of eggnog.

161
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,785
I do love eggnog.
Write this down.

162
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,490
What's the difference
between "try" and "triumph"?

163
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,041
A little oomph?
A little oomph.

164
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,661
Get it? Of course I get it.
I just said it.

165
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,917
Eeeh! I'm gonna kill you
when I find you, silly dog!

166
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,876
Why don't you come back?
Stella!

167
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,800
I have a theory. Ay, Cam,
thank you for helping me.

168
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,474
Oh, it's my pleasure.
Stella!

169
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,051
Stella!

170
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,685
Oh, my God.
What? You see her?

171
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,266
No.

172
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,898
But I see myself in the role
I was born to play.

173
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,401
Stella!

174
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,243
Stella!

175
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,790
Hello?

176
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,868
Oh, Mitchell, you are
not gonna believe this.

177
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,954
I'm out helping Gloria
look for her dog.

178
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:19,917
I'm wearing an undershirt, and I'm screaming
"Stella," just like in Streetcar.

179
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,385
Hello ? You didn't
clean the kitchen!

180
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,929
Mitchell, I am an inadvertent
Stanley Kowalski.

181
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,554
- How can you not be delighted by this?
- You promised.

182
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,384
I was called away
for an emergency.

183
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,469
Gloria's lost her dog,
and she's heartbroken.

184
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:34,853
Where are you, dumb dog?
I hope in a big black hole!

185
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:38,652
I cannot believe that you
did this to me yet again. Oh.

186
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:40,525
I didn't do anything.

187
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,605
I cooked a meal
in our kitchen.

188
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:46,489
Then you left on purpose, knowing I would not
be able to sit here without cleaning it up.

189
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:49,822
Life is messy sometimes.
Big deal. It gets cleaned up.

190
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:53,701
You're the one with the problem if you can't
leave a few dirty dishes for a couple hours.

191
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,127
Okay, okay. Fine, Cam.
I'm not cleaning it up.

192
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,292
Great.
I mean it.

193
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,339
Perfect. You know what?
Why don't you make it bigger?

194
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,838
You know what?
I will. l-l- I will-

195
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,805
Okay, you know, get ready, because you are
gonna come home to a- to a giant mess.

196
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,635
And I will give him a giant hug
when I get there.

197
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,264
Stella!

198
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,940
Hey, Dad.
Think fast.

199
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,815
Oh! Wow, buddy.
I'm sorry.

200
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:24,774
I told you, I gotta change the lightbulbs and
then help your mom with those signatures.

201
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,608
Never mind.

202
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,819
Guess it was
a stupid idea anyways.

203
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,372
I've always said that if my son thinks
of me as one of his idiot friends,

204
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:34,995
then I've succeeded as a dad.

205
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,578
If he wants to go the wrong way
on the escalator, I'm on board.

206
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,129
If he wants to go into a restaurant
and pretend we're Australian, then-

207
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:41,707
G'day, mate.

208
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,384
Toss a few shrimp on the barbie
for me and my joey.

209
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,963
Yeah, right? Nicole Kidman?
Men At Work?

210
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,766
Here we go.
Take 12.

211
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,639
- Hey, buddy, I'm home!
- Hey, Dad. Think fast!

212
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,391
0w!

213
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,770
Wow. You know, my arm's
starting to hurt a little.

214
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,691
Really?
'Cause my face feels great.

215
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,861
Come on, Dad. Let's not
turn on each other.

216
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:06,110
- We could be here a while.
- Yeah, okay. You're right.

217
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,362
Here we go.
Take nine-

218
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,069
You're not even trying.

219
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,955
Daddy, Fm hungry-

220
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,499
What do you want, honey?
Raisins.

221
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,580
All right.
Well, go get 'em.

222
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,629
It's too high, Daddy.
I can't reach.

223
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,713
For the record,
I am not a neat freak.

224
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,346
In fact, in my first
long-term relationship,

225
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,849
I was the messy one,
which is why she broke up with me.

226
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:38,430
Well-

227
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,732
No, thanks.
Okay.

228
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,020
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let me show you how it's done.

229
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,739
Hiya. Jay Pritchett here. Holidays
are just around the corner.

230
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,820
Sorry. I don't believe
in wrapping paper.

231
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,157
What do you mean, you don't believe in wrapping paper?
It's not Bigfoot. It exists.

232
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,956
It's not eco-friendly. It's wasteful.
No, not this stuff.

233
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:03,288
This paper was made from
100% recycled materials.

234
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:06,166
I don't think so.

235
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,502
I can't understand
what you're saying.

236
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,633
She's an ugly little
French Bulldog ...

237
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,965
with the tiny ears
and the smooshy face.

238
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,141
What is so hard
to understand?

239
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,184
Maybe I should translate.

240
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:22,058
I really don't like people coming to my door
unannounced while I'm working on my carving.

241
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,270
I understand. But a stop
sign is really important.

242
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,739
What exactly
are you carving?

243
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,657
Hello, ma'am.
Do you love Christmas?

244
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:34,452
Actually, I'm Jewish.

245
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,201
Well, then you must
appreciate a good value.

246
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,827
Ah, geez.

247
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:41,626
If you see her,
let us know.

248
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:47,424
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, no!

249
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,466
Are you kidding?
Seriously?

250
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,716
See, you're not keeping
your head in the right position.

251
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,514
I know that's me, but I'm not
remembering any of this.

252
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,685
- Oh! Stupid neighbors.
- What's wrong?

253
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,888
I can't ask for a simple signature,

254
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,813
but it's fine for them
to build a house ...

255
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,937
that looks like the Beverly
Hillbillies just moved in.

256
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,939
Did you do any better?

257
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,020
We came close
a few times, but-

258
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,572
You're not talking about
the basketball, are you?

259
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,776
Phil, tell me
you got some signatures.

260
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,156
I have to be at city hall
in, like, two hours.

261
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,080
Oh, God.
Haley, how about you?

262
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,249
I've been busy
with my college essay.

263
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:24,794
- Really? Where is it?
- It's in a rough, rough draft right now.

264
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,917
I've been thinking that
maybe that I should-

265
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,998
Alex has been Skyping with her
boyfriend since you left.

266
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,755
That's so not true!

267
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:34,178
Thank you, really. Thank all
of you so much for your help.

268
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,595
Really?

269
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:42,095
Sometimes those things need to
warm up, like a car. Phil, don't even!

270
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,432
I have been out there trying to do
something good for our community ...

271
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:48,644
because, let me tell you,
change doesn't just happen.

272
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,696
It is forged
by empowered women ...

273
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:55,617
like me and Norma Rae
and the lady from The Blind Side.

274
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,990
You know what the difference is
between me and her?

275
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:00,071
Blind Side's family had her back.

276
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,539
Okay.
Huddle up, everybody.

277
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,379
Your mother's right.

278
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:12,751
She's the quarterback of this family, and
we need to protect her like Blind Side did.

279
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:15,007
She just said the mom
was Blind Side.

280
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,885
Well, she's confused. Blind Side was
the black kid who played tight end.

281
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,807
Offensive line.

282
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,260
Sorry.
African-American kid.

283
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:32,020
There she is! Oh!

284
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,652
¡Ay! Stella!

285
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:38,907
Ay. Thank God you found my dog.
Thank you!

286
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,158
This is my dog.
Her name's Pinky.

287
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,992
No, it's not. Her name is Stella. It
says right here on the tag. Look.

288
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,951
Uh, excuse me.
Hi, sweetie.

289
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,544
What's your name?
Blanche.

290
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,088
Shut up.
Mitchell would die.

291
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,758
Listen, we don't know you. You seem
like a very sweet little girl.

292
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,838
Right now we're forced to- I can't
believe I'm saying this to you-

293
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,843
rely on the kindness
of strangers.

294
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,220
I'll sell her to you
for $200.

295
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,802
That's it.
Give me my dog!

296
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,393
Really? The little girl thinks
because she can scream,

297
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:08,974
she can get away
with everything?

298
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,900
I can scream too.

299
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,698
What the hell sound
is that?

300
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,950
Coyotes must've
got a cat.

301
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,532
Jay, can we stop now?
I'm getting hungry.

302
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,538
You know what the problem is?
You're not hungry.

303
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,836
I had a carrot at 3:00.

304
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,380
What if you couldn't feed your family
unless you made this next sale?

305
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,549
What if you were gonna
lose your house?

306
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:38,504
I know I was pushing the kid
hard, but here's the thing.

307
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,556
I'm an older dad.
I'm not gonna be around forever.

308
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:44,805
And I'll sleep better knowin' he's
got somethin' to fall back on.

309
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:47,145
Come on, let's hit another one.
I can't do it.

310
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,605
What? I don't have
what it takes.

311
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,566
What kind of talk is that?
it's the truth, Jay.

312
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,486
I'm not a great salesman.
I'm not a great businessman.

313
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,313
I'm not you.

314
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,946
Do you know what it's like to see all
the amazing things you've accomplished,

315
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,742
knowing I never will?

316
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,822
How am I supposed to live up to you?
How is anyone?

317
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:11,211
Ah, so the fish weren't biting today.
So what? That's life.

318
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:14,255
You tried hard,
and that's what matters.

319
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,003
Yeah.

320
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,715
You know, I- I actually
need some wrapping paper.

321
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,259
Do you know where I can find some?
You don't have to do that.

322
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,806
I want to do it.

323
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,805
You'll never go broke
playing to a rich guy's ego.

324
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,387
Write that down.

325
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,564
Okay. Thank you so much,
you guys.

326
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:34,605
Make a wish.
Uh, hi. Oh, sorry.

327
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:37,358
Um, I'm here for
the traffic committee meeting.

328
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,984
The meeting's
been adjourned.

329
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,698
Yeah, um-
it's my birthday.

330
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,650
I'm sorry.
Happy birthday.

331
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,949
L- Just someone sent me to the wrong room,
and you guys don't meet again for months,

332
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,872
and this is pretty much
a matter of life and death, so-

333
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,293
Uh- Yes. Fine.
Uh, just-

334
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,712
If you could make it quick.
This is an ice cream cake.

335
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,664
Okay.
Actually, it's not.

336
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,291
What?
No.

337
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,375
Really?

338
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:03,717
Oh, then we're not
in a rush, I guess, at all.

339
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:06,057
No rush. Go ahead.
Great.

340
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:09,181
My name is Claire Dunphy, and my family
and I live near that intersection-

341
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,558
Why not? Why not?

342
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,686
The freezer was broken,
and we couldn't keep it here.

343
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,893
See, this is why I
ask you to think ahead, okay?

344
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,070
Do you have
your 50 signatures?

345
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:22,149
Uh, almost. I have 34.
But I-

346
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,326
Oh.
That's the same thing.

347
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:29,201
- Wow, I'm confused.
- It's not the same thing.

348
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,624
No. Thirty-four is not
the same thing as 50,

349
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:36,956
just like a cake is not the same
thing as an ice cream cake.

350
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,791
Right. I get that. Sir, I'm
trying to save lives here.

351
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,260
Mom! Mom, Mom! And I can get you
the rest of those signatures-

352
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,008
Oh, my God. What are you doing here?
Girls-

353
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,760
We went door-to-door, and we
got you 20 more signatures.

354
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,350
That's so sweet of you.

355
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,469
Well, you were freaking
out at us, so- Okay.

356
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,805
You know, let's not ruin it.
All right.

357
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:56,482
Fifty-four signatures.

358
00:16:56,557 --> 00:17:00,653
So, what do you say? Let's start saving
lives one intersection at a time.

359
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,277
Okay. Thank you very much. We will,
uh, take these under advisement.

360
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,200
- Just leave them here, and thank you.
- Wait a minute!

361
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,448
- I know what that means.
- Oh, here we go.

362
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,530
That's Washington-speak
for "Get lost."

363
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:14,117
Well, um- Wow, Phil.
What are you doing here?

364
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,579
I'm your husband.
I'm blindsiding you.

365
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,164
Uh-

366
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,167
Your Honor, permission to approach.
Not a judge.

367
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,718
I'll allow it.

368
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,761
I'll get straight to the point,
because this is important,

369
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,463
and that appears to be
an ice cream cake.

370
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,345
Well, it's not!

371
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:35,430
Okay. I present to you
"Stop in the Name of Life."

372
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,766
Kick it!

373
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,441
Clive Bixby.

374
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:43,897
Can I meet you at Harry's Bar
in two minutes?

375
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,574
Baby, I can do anything
in two minutes.

376
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,284
Ooh.  Oh.

377
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:52,080
I'll just speed through the
intersection at Greenleaf and Bristol.

378
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:55,658
It's easy,
'cause there's no stop sign.

379
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,085
I love being a kid.

380
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,083
I have my whole life
ahead of me.

381
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:12,472
- Nooooo!
- Nooooo!

382
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:14,594
Okay.

383
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,179
Well- Powerful.

384
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,560
And unconventional.

385
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,643
But I believe
it makes our point.

386
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,399
So, what do you say?

387
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,104
Well, the kid
was all right.

388
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,939
I didn't care for you
so much.

389
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:32,325
But if I were to give a stop sign to
everybody who wanted a stop sign,

390
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:35,202
- this city would grind to a halt.
- I understand, sir, but-

391
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,908
- Thank you. Good-bye.
- Allow me. Allow me!

392
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,459
Ladies and gentlemen,

393
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,081
I've lived with this woman
for 20 years.

394
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:44,416
- Mm-hmm.
- If she wants a stop sign, there's gonna be a stop sign.

395
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,841
Mm-hmm.
He's right.

396
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,293
Listen to the man.
Yeah.

397
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,346
It's deli-
No good? ¿No bueno?

398
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,467
I'm home!

399
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,598
Oh, hey.
Did you find Stella?

400
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,721
Safe and sound.
Mmm.

401
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,774
Oh! Hey!

402
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:05,319
I did it. I left the mess.
Aren't you proud of me?

403
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,362
I sure am.
Good for you.

404
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:10,533
It wasn't easy at first,
but I just took Lily to the park,

405
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,403
and I completely put it out of my mind.

406
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,659
And I think I really
cleared a hurdle today.

407
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,991
Oh, that's great.
I'm super proud of you.

408
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,872
And you're not even tempted
to clean it up now?

409
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,335
No!
That's great.

410
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,878
Not now that you're home.

411
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,877
- So, guess I better get started.
- Yeah.

412
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:34,799
I don't like this.

413
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,350
It's so gross.

414
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,223
Oh, my God.

415
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,221
What?
I was right.

416
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:43,103
- You wanted me to clean it up.
- Oh, that's preposterous.

417
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:46,603
I will not stand here and
take this from you. Oh, Cam!

418
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,405
"Life is messy.
I love chaos."

419
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,529
You are so full of it.
Well, you know what?

420
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,538
That's all right. No worries. Hey,
come on, come on. Just embrace it.

421
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:00,124
It's life. Oh, okay.
Now, that is gratuitous.

422
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:02,790
That's Lily's favorite cereal.
Oh, it's okay. No!

423
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:06,247
Relax. Hey, Lily.
Honey, come here.

424
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,254
Sweetheart, do you want
a princess hat?

425
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,377
Yes, Yes, yes!
Okay.

426
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,758
Okay, that-
that is enough! No!

427
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:15,886
You've proven your point!
I don't like to clean up.

428
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:19,014
It's smelly, it's sticky, and after I
eat, I'm tired, I just want to lay down.

429
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:22,935
And you put it off, knowing that I would do it.
Yes! Are you happy?

430
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,812
Yes ... I ... am.

431
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:35,985
Hi. I'm Ellen Roberts
from the adoption agency.

432
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,038
I'm ... here
for the home visit.

433
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:40,865
Oh!

434
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,827
I might need
to tweak my system.

435
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,915
Hey, Dad. Think fast!

436
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,385
Sacagawea

437
00:20:57,715 --> 00:20:58,762
Wait, wait.
I need a break.

438
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,935
John Philip Sousa!

439
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,928
Oh, my God.
Seventy-eight views.

440
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,185
We are on our way.

441
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,937
Yeah, we are.

442
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:11,567
You know what, Lukey? My dad was away a lot,
and I'm not gonna do that to you.

443
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:17,242
I'm gonna be the kind of dad-

444
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:20,238
How many more of these
do you want to do?

445
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:23,157
English - US - PSDH
