1
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:13,514
This week the
world lost a great man,

2
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:15,975
and I lost a mentor.

3
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:20,188
For nearly 60 years
Professor Ringmaster Al Uzielli ...

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,615
helped young hopefuls like me
find their clown persona.

5
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,368
Professor Ringmaster?

6
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,366
It's a very prestigious title
at clown college.

7
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,994
One step below
Piemaster General.

8
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,915
Where's Lewis?
Who knows?

9
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:37,872
Okay, guys, it's just us.
Lift on three.

10
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:17,246
# Hey, hey #

11
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,499
# Hey ##

12
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:23,797
Hey, how come you guys haven't
accepted my friend requests?

13
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,468
I didn't know
you were on Facebook.

14
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:27,888
Yeah, you said it was only for teenagers
and people looking to have affairs.

15
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:29,886
Well, I figured
if you can't fight it-

16
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:32,764
Not having the affair.
That's still bad. No, not that.

17
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:36,518
But there's nothing wrong with catching
up with a few old friends, right?

18
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:39,851
Or doin' a little social
networking with my B.F.F.'s.

19
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,310
Mmm.
Yeah.

20
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:43,942
Social networking
or social not-working?

21
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:47,441
Oh, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get
a picture of us all together on a boat.

22
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:51,950
I think that's a thing now. So what do you say?
Accept my friend thingy.

23
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:55,078
Sorry, Mom, I- I didn't get
a friend thingy from you.

24
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:59,253
Yeah, you know, they have a lot of blocks
on there to protect kids from weirdos.

25
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,293
Mmm, okay. Good, good.
I'll send it again. Great.

26
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,874
Please do.

27
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,129
Please don't.

28
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,256
We got her request
the first time, but ignored it.

29
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:08,883
I can't have her on there
snooping around,

30
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,464
seeing what I'm doing
at parties.

31
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,549
Or posting pictures of us
on family vacations ...

32
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,727
wearing old, dorky clothes.

33
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,054
What?

34
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,684
What's wrong
with this?

35
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,727
Dad, check it out.
I made one giant Oreo.

36
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,067
Luke, what are you doing?

37
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,990
- You gotta eat it like it's an ear of corn.
- Genius.

38
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,654
Oh.
Wow. New suit.

39
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:31,951
New everything.

40
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:35,156
Kids, gather round.
it's time for a life lesson.

41
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,286
Aren't we
already gathered?

42
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,289
Let me tell you something.

43
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:44,090
Hard work, determination
and perseverance always win out.

44
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:48,294
I am living proof that
nice guys can finish first.

45
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:49,845
Today I have
a chance to get ...

46
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,422
the biggest listing
of my career.

47
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,849
Oh, I have never seen
this man so focused.

48
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:56,347
I'm like a boxer
before the big fight.

49
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,350
That's why I didn't have sex with
Claire last night. Sorry, honey.

50
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,931
Mmm. No, it's-
it's okay.

51
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:04,435
But as soon as I get this listing- ding!
Let's just stop.

52
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,395
Stop.

53
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:13,201
I see you. What? I'm scratching.

54
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:17,702
Hey, Mom, is it okay if I have
a friend come over tomorrow?

55
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,033
Who? Reuben?

56
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,414
Or the nervous one
that gets the nosebleed?

57
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:22,745
It's Griffin Cooper.

58
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,171
Griffin Cooper?

59
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:25,714
Griffin Cooper is by far ...

60
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,336
the coolest kid in Manny's grade.

61
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,090
He's a terrific athlete.
He's confident.

62
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,921
Manny's a great kid, sure,
but he's not exactly cool.

63
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,723
He can't even
open a door cool.

64
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,051
Salutations, Wyatt.

65
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,762
I'm so glad you're joining me
for an afternoon of mirth.

66
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,473
Good evening,
Reuben-san.

67
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,274
May I ask you
to remove your shoes?

68
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,022
Tonight
we are going Japanese.

69
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:50,402
Ah!

70
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,448
I invented a new language
this morning.

71
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,197
When did you guys
become buddies?

72
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,779
Was it a football game in the yard?
You made a great catch?

73
00:03:56,862 --> 00:04:01,242
No, that didn't happen. But the librarian
told me one day I'll be a great catch.

74
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,041
Well, I'm really not
getting that relationship.

75
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:08,670
Why can't you just be happy that
Manny's making new friends?

76
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,296
'Cause
it doesn't add up.

77
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,720
Cool kids like Griffin Cooper, they
don't hang out with kids like Manny.

78
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,217
Manny's very cool.

79
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,971
Maybe those kids
are finally catching up to him.

80
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,598
Wait a minute. I get it.

81
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:24,602
Couple of days last week, I took
Manny to school on my motorcycle.

82
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,059
Griffin must think
I'm pretty boss.

83
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:30,146
Yes, Jay.
it's all because of you.

84
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,105
Kids are lookin' for role models.

85
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,317
Why do you think Fonzie
was so popular?

86
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,745
He told people that they were rich, but
really took their money with his scheme?

87
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,367
No, that's a-

88
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,123
Yes.

89
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,668
Those people were victims
of a Fonzie scheme.

90
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,211
Mmm.

91
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,926
Whew.

92
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,469
it's showtime.

93
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,010
Hey, Dunphy. You gettin' ready
for your one-woman show?

94
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,264
Mitzi.

95
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:03,971
Mitzi Roth.

96
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:07,729
A notorious poacher in the world of
high-end residential real estate.

97
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,436
We call her
the nightmare on Elm Street ...

98
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,443
because she sold a lot
of houses on Elm Street.

99
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:16,822
What are you doing here, Mitzi? I have
an appointment. This is my listing.

100
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,403
Oh, I didn't think that was
dotted-line yet, jazz hands.

101
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,330
No worries.
I may have an interested buyer.

102
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,157
I'll bring him to you.
Really?

103
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,910
Okay, but could you come back later? I
really need to have 'em to myself right now.

104
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,834
Oh, yeah, okay. I completely understand.
Okay. Thanks.

105
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,381
You're welcome.

106
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,800
Wait. What?

107
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,339
What are you doing?

108
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,795
Watch this.  Hello?

109
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,763
It's Mitzi Roth.
And Phil Dunphy.

110
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,137
I may have a prospective buyer
for your beautiful house.

111
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,477
I was wondering if maybe I could
come in- Hey, Stan. Hey, Patti.

112
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,179
And just have a look
for a little while.

113
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,021
We got a lot to talk about.
Come on in.

114
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,644
Um-

115
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:52,773
Hey, guys, yeah, I'm wondering if
maybe we shouldn't be alone for this.

116
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:54,984
I'm in.

117
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,907
Go back to condos,
Dunphy.

118
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:01,829
Oh, my God, this place
is absolutely gorgeous.

119
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,367
Stunning. Stunning.

120
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,325
You are in such good
hands with Phil.

121
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,376
Hey.
How are you GUYS?

122
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,953
I mean,
fingers crossed though.

123
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,915
You know, so many new companies
go belly-up. Terrible.

124
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,921
Well, good to-
good to see you, Mitzi.

125
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,885
Guys, how are you? Oh, no, no. it's fine.
it's fine. Come take a look.

126
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,804
Oh, thank you.

127
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,514
Mitzi, please.
Thank you.

128
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,513
Mitzi, please.
Please.

129
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,056
What are you doing? Oh, my God!
He shoved me!

130
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,513
What?
He shoved me!

131
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,685
- For God's sake! Phil!
- Oh, my God!

132
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,233
I thought you had your anger
problem under control.

133
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,357
I don't have an anger-

134
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:38,031
I don't- Anger problem-
I don't have an anger problem.

135
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,701
Oh, hey. it's over?
What the hell?

136
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,245
- You're an hour late.
- Good to see you too, Chuckleberry.

137
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,824
Look at that. Your oversized
pants are startin' to fit.

138
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:50,335
Hello, Lewis.

139
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,871
Hello, Fizbo.

140
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,548
For several years,
I was one half of ...

141
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,092
the renowned clown duo
Fizbo and Lewis.

142
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,510
We were huge.

143
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,087
In children's parties.

144
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,969
Anyway, I disbanded the group
shortly after I met Mitchell.

145
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:06,222
It's hard to have a relationship
and a clown career.

146
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,474
That's the reason there are
so many single clowns.

147
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,975
It's just
one of the reasons.

148
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:12,228
Anyway, um, Lewis
hasn't spoken to me since.

149
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:14,605
He's still bitter,
and I don't blame him.

150
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,812
It's kind of like
I broke up the Beatles.

151
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:19,523
Of children's parties.

152
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,234
What do you say we hit a bar?
Tip a few back to Al, huh?

153
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,032
I heard you were in jail. Yeah?

154
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,159
I heard you're still doin' that lame
giant-scissors bit, you blue-haired hack.

155
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,954
Who's in? I'll go.
Just give me a minute.

156
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,582
I gotta redo my lips.
All right. Cerveza.

157
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,463
What about you,
Fizzy?

158
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,836
You gonna come, or are you gonna
break up this party too'?

159
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,470
Hey, shotgun, bitches!

160
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,720
I should, you know, probably go.
You know, for- for Al.

161
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,804
Oh, yeah. No, of course. But listen,
don't let him get to you, all right?

162
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,435
No, it's fine. it's all
seltzer under the bridge.

163
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,391
Just one drink
and then I'll be home.

164
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:57,440
Okay. Just drive me home first?
No, you- you take the car.

165
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,442
I, uh-
I'll go with the guys.

166
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:03,196
In that tiny car? How are
you all possibly gonna-

167
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,992
Forget I asked.

168
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,999
It's 5:00 in the morning.

169
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,750
Daddy's juggling.

170
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,131
Lily, honey, what-
what are you doing up?

171
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,505
Are you just getting home? Yeah,
things got a little out of hand.

172
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,089
Somebody had a ?ower
that squirted tequila.

173
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,051
What do you mean, "somebody"?
I want full credit.

174
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,473
What up, red? Really?

175
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,938
Teach me to juggle! it's very simple.

176
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:37,860
The key is to be aware of where
everything is at all times.

177
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:44,487
And don't forget the
importance of balance- Whoa!

178
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:47,490
- Okay, okay. Come on.
- I think I cracked my eggs.

179
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,115
We're out of eggs?
Are you yolking?

180
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,121
I haven't eaten in five days!

181
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,250
Five days?
Are you cereal?

182
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,956
Whoa!

183
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,543
Lily,
don't ever do that.

184
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:10,601
Okay. You two are deliberately
not confirming me.

185
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,894
Everybody else has
accepted my friend requests.

186
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,813
Your father.
Uncle Mitchell.

187
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,232
Adele.

188
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,729
That's right.

189
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,981
Adele has agreed to be my friend,
and my own daughters haven't.

190
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,940
Yeah, you may just be
a fan of Adele and not-

191
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,116
What is so private
that I can't possibly see it?

192
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,613
Nothing.

193
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,320
Nothing. So you just ...
don't want to be my friend.

194
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,202
That's great. I can see
my next status update.

195
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,828
"My daughters
are monsters."

196
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,785
You're
not gonna believe this.

197
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,415
Mitzi got the listing.

198
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,543
Oh, no, honey.
That's awful!

199
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,545
She cheated, she lied,
and she won.

200
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,464
Kids, gather round.
Again, we are gathered.

201
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,217
You want to get ahead?
Don't play by the rules.

202
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:52,472
Turns out nice guys finish last
in this cold, dog-eat-dog world.

203
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:56,430
It's not fair. Why don't you play dirty too?
You could take her down.

204
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,187
Honey, 'cause your dad
is a better man than that.

205
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,026
He has values and morals and- Shh.
You. Keep talking.

206
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,651
Well, just off
the top of my head,

207
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,778
you could take my spy pen and
record her admitting what she did.

208
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:11,361
And then you could play it for those people
so they'd realize what a jerk she is.

209
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,037
Your dad is never
gonna do that.

210
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:16,162
You're a regular chatterbox today.
Get me that pen.

211
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,539
I got it.  Remember,
pal, keep it simple.

212
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,550
Hey, Manny.

213
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,094
Griffin, the legendary
creature of Greek mythology ...

214
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,763
with the head of a lion
and wings of an eagle.

215
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,133
What'd you say, Jay?
Never mind.

216
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,434
Jay Pritchett.
Nice to meet you.

217
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,436
Nice to
meet you too.

218
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,188
You know, I, uh-

219
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:45,237
I saw a little of that basketball
game of yours last week.

220
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,355
You were lightin' it up. Thanks.

221
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,361
I was lighting it up
too, Jay.

222
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,192
Who's hot? We're hot!

223
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:53,153
Mustangs are hot!

224
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,739
Brrrr! Whoo!
Brrrr! Hey!

225
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,746
Hola, Griffin.
How are you?

226
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,879
Uh- Oh!
Thirteen.

227
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:04,790
I'm fine.

228
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,046
So what do you boys
have planned for today?

229
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,846
Well, it's kind of a surprise for Griffin,
but let's just say it involves decoupage.

230
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,593
Oh, geez.
Come on. Let's go.

231
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,263
Good-bye.

232
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,104
Oh, no.

233
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,973
What?
You were right.

234
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,354
This boy is not here
to see Manny.

235
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,562
I told you. You see the
way he looks at me?

236
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,568
No, Fonzie,
the way he looks at me.

237
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,196
He couldn't talk.
He kept staring.

238
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,744
He was just like my teachers
back in school.

239
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:38,540
Gloria, you're very pretty,
but the kid idolizes me.

240
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,288
Really?

241
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:42,831
Griffin! Manny!

242
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,334
Do you want to go with Jay
to ride his motorcycle,

243
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:49,134
or you want to go with me to the
supermarket and buy a couple of onions?

244
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,003
Motorcycle rides!
Onions sound good.

245
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,383
Huh.

246
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,429
Guess he has
a thing for you too.

247
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,182
Hey.
We're back.

248
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,229
Hey, I- I just finished
cleaning the kitchen,

249
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:05,184
so if anyone has to do a spit
take, please do it over the sink.

250
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:08,145
We felt really bad about that,
so we got you a present.

251
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:12,028
Wh-What's the deal with this? I open it
up, and snakes fly out, or a fire, or-

252
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,992
No. We just know that you like to read.
So open it. Yeah.

253
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,787
- Ah! Got him!
- No. No.

254
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,741
That's exactly what I expected.
Remember when I told you?

255
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,702
Okay, look, it's almost go time. So we
should have a shot and go white up.

256
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,708
Excuse me.
White up?

257
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,960
Oh, yeah, Lewis got a call to do
a birthday party this afternoon,

258
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,962
so we're gonna put
the old act back together.

259
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,341
Yeah, Fizbo and Lewis, together again.
And they said it would never happen.

260
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,343
Said. Hoped. Could I talk
to you for a second?

261
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,095
Uh-oh.
Trouble in queeradise.

262
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,893
Okay, look, gonna go out
to the car for smokes.

263
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,230
Please tell me "smokes"
is not another clown.

264
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:47,271
'Cause I don't think I could handle another
one of him. Lewis is not that bad.

265
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,899
- What do you see in that guy, Cam?
- I don't know.

266
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,982
Maybe the fact that he doesn't roll his eyes
every time I talk about the art of clowning.

267
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,361
Like that.

268
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,989
He may have had his faults,
but we were great together.

269
00:12:57,068 --> 00:13:01,665
We had an unspoken language. We
finished each other's balloon animals.

270
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:06,415
But you would never know, because you have
never been to one of our performances.

271
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,791
Birthday parties.

272
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,415
You hate my clown side.
No.

273
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,341
No, no.
I don't hate it.

274
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:15,170
Just admit it.
I basically already know you do.

275
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:18,348
Okay, okay.
Cards on the table.

276
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,596
- It's not my favorite thing that you-
- Oh, how dare you!

277
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,973
I am a clown.
it's who I am.

278
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,929
If you squeeze me,
do I not honk?

279
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,729
Eye roll. Oh, like
I had a choice.

280
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,647
Knock-knock.

281
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,198
What are you
doing here?

282
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,401
Hey, um, I-
I brought you some soup.

283
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,487
You know, I thought about it,
and maybe I did push you.

284
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,823
So, how's the ankle?

285
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,829
Oh, come on, Dunphy.
You know I flopped.

286
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,831
Haven't you ever seen
an NBA game?

287
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,380
Oh, I'm sorry.
In your case, WNBA.

288
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,504
So that was all a ruse?

289
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,587
The oldest trick in the book. You
need to step up your game, son.

290
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,593
You know what?
I almost feel sorry for you.

291
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,300
Come here.
Give me a big hug.

292
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,636
Oh, yeah, yeah.

293
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,638
No hard feelings, huh?
None at all.

294
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,733
Good. Because I just recorded
your entire confession.

295
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,309
Right here on my-

296
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,611
Spy Den?

297
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,688
Second-oldest trick
in the book.

298
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,360
Um-  Oh, God.

299
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,239
A real man would have
just poisoned the soup.

300
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,112
Are we done here?

301
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,958
Ah, thank you.

302
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,710
Hey, Mom!
Guess what!

303
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:36,293
Griffin invited us all over to his house
for a pool party and barbecue tonight.

304
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:39,095
- Pool party, huh?
- Yeah, and he said bring your swimsuits.

305
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,717
He was pretty adamant
about it.

306
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,219
It's 50 degrees outside.

307
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,468
Sounds fun. Great.
I'll call him.

308
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,514
You know, you're basically agreeing
to a date with a 13-year-old boy.

309
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,066
Jay, we use this to get us
tables at restaurants.

310
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,269
Why can't we use this
to get Manny a friend?

311
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,613
Because he's not really
getting a friend. Oh.

312
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,531
But when you thought that he was trying
to ride your motorcycle, it was okay.

313
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,780
Maybe now I don't like
what he's trying to ride.

314
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,452
Manny likes Griffin.

315
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:06,828
Maybe someday, if they spend enough
time together, Griffin will like Manny.

316
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,954
What?
Griffin doesn't like me?

317
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,287
No, no, no, papi,
he loves you.

318
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:16,125
But you just said someday Griffin will like me.
That means he doesn't like me now.

319
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:18,005
You know what, kid?

320
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,587
We think that Griffin ...

321
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,593
might be
hanging out with you ...

322
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:25,425
because he's got a little
crush on your mother and me.

323
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,053
On you? Wow. I can't believe it.

324
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,555
Listen, it's fine. You're gonna be fine.
I'm sorry.

325
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,025
Are you kidding? it's fantastic!
How is it fantastic?

326
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,149
I'm only hanging out with him because
I have the hots for his sister Chloe.

327
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:39,151
You've met Griffin.
The kid's a doorknob.

328
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,949
So you're
just using him?

329
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,868
Yeah, and I felt
really guilty about it until now.

330
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,034
Now it's a win-win.
Not for me.

331
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,535
Just suck it up, Mom.

332
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,367
I've done a lot for you over the years.
Jay, you too.

333
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:54,796
This girl could be the one. Then
I'm out of your hair forever.

334
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,873
Pool party, Mom.
Dress accordingly.

335
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:05,385
Can you help me reach that
box of cereal?

336
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:06,717
Hey.

337
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,222
You're Mitzi Roth. I
recognized you from your ads.

338
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:12,017
Smokin', right?
I'm Luke Dunphy.

339
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:15,062
My dad's Phil Dunphy.
I'm sorry.

340
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,643
Why do you hate him
so much?

341
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,320
It's just business, kid.
It's not personal.

342
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,148
Well, it's personal to us.

343
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,280
I've never seen my dad
so worried before.

344
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:28,613
I have this spy pen, and I
heard him talking to my mom,

345
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:32,326
and he's scared about paying for
my sister's college next year.

346
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,287
And I guess he's nervous
about some kind of party,

347
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:38,339
because he said there's
a big balloon payment.

348
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,839
Anyways, he's, like,
the best dad ever,

349
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:45,092
so maybe you could be
a little nicer to him.

350
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,673
There you are,
buddy.

351
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:49,384
Check it out. They're giving
away free jelly beans.

352
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,262
Hi, Mitzi.
Dunphy.

353
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,689
You have
a very nice kid there.

354
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,311
He's mine.

355
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,359
Hey. So I was thinking-

356
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,486
After Little Fizbo,
we could do the ladder bit.

357
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,488
Ah, crap,
I forgot the ladder.

358
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,490
You know what? I'll
remember it next weekend.

359
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,617
What's next weekend?

360
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,698
We got a town fair
in Thousand Oaks ...

361
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,705
and a birthday party
in Pasadena.

362
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,912
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I- I can't do that.

363
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,247
What do you mean? I'm the one with
outstanding warrants in Pasadena.

364
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,879
No, we're taking Lily to
the aquarium next weekend.

365
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,132
You know, Lewis, this was
just a one-time thing, right?

366
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,760
Well, what happened to we're
puttin' the act back together?

367
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,091
Well, that was
just for today.

368
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,847
Oh.

369
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,515
Oh, sure.

370
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,014
I'm sorry if you thought- No, no, no.
I get it.

371
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,099
You're a family man now.

372
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:40,689
Hey.

373
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:46,149
Let's go out there and make this the best
show Fizbo and Lewis have ever done.

374
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,990
You got it, partner.

375
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,368
Ladies and germs,
boys and girls,

376
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:58,954
say hello to my good friend,
Little Fizbo!

377
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,217
Hello, big people.

378
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,295
Hi!

379
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:10,678
Let's get this party started!

380
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:19,061
Wow, all this dancing
sure has made me hungry.

381
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,983
Wish I had something to eat.

382
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,943
Oh, forgot I had
that fish over there.

383
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:28,992
Don't know why he's so mad at me.
He was fine just a minute ago.

384
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:32,570
Oh! Okay. Somebody's
a little punchy today.

385
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,951
Hey, what's the frying pan
doing here?

386
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:38,376
When did we add a frying pan to the act?
Nope, don't need the frying pan.

387
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,421
Why are you doing that?
Stop doing that.

388
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,294
- Screw you, you traitor.
- Ow! That hurts! Seriously. Stop it.

389
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,671
You know what hurts?
Abandonment.

390
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,967
Listen to 'em laughing.
We could've been something.

391
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,803
We could've been-
I can't do this bit by myself!

392
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:03,063
Somebody- Somebody-

393
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,816
This isn't pretend!
Someone grab an adult, please!

394
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,365
Mitzi. Your kid
forgot his cereal.

395
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:15,788
There's a surprise
in every box.

396
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,082
it's diabetes.

397
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,660
You drove all the way
over here for this?

398
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:23,838
Okay, look, here's the deal. You can
have that listing if you want it.

399
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,252
What? Yeah. The couple
are a real pain.

400
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:27,959
I'm too old for
that kind of headache.

401
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,587
Just keep your mouth shut about it.
Thank you so much.

402
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,172
I just said zip it!

403
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,593
Oh. You did-
Unbelievable.

404
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,637
I'm so sorry. But thank you.

405
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,184
Bye.

406
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,804
Kids, gather round!

407
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,897
We are right here!
Oh.

408
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,020
Let me tell you
something.

409
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,353
People are
fundamentally good.

410
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,154
The key is, you find that
goodness deep within them,

411
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,860
twist it and turn it
to your advantage.

412
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,194
Hello.
Pshh!

413
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:57,246
And there she is.

414
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,789
What are you
gonna hit?

415
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,741
College, balloon payment,
greatest dad ever.

416
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:04,120
- Nice. You want me to squirt some tears in your eyes?
- Dad, please.

417
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,547
I was fake crying
before I could walk.

418
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,626
How do you think I got out
of eating all those salads?

419
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:18,639
Can you help me reach that
box of cereal?

420
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,641
Oh, hey, you're
Mitzi Roth, right?

421
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,188
I recognized you
from your ads.

422
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,181
Smokin', huh?

423
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:28,186
I can't believe you got that
listing back, honey! Sweetheart!

424
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,527
Ohh.
Honey.

425
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,647
Mm-hmm?
Ding.

426
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,905
Are you sure you want
to ding a chatterbox?

427
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,203
Hmm.
Wh- Uh-

428
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:38,655
Honey.

429
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,866
Quick. What's the trick
to those fake tears?

430
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,791
The Three Stooges
are all dead.

431
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,453
Yeah, that's good.

432
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:53,211
Well, it looks like
somebody likes Coldplay.

433
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:54,762
Hmm. Right. You saw.

434
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,009
Uh-huh.

435
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,716
Did you see the pictures
I posted from Thanksgiving?

436
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,845
Totes adorbs. I'm
going to kill myself.

437
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,771
You gotta check out my wall.
Right there.

438
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:07,771
"Spring Break, 1990,
New Orleans."

439
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,069
Is that you?
What?

440
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:12,442
Some guy from your college
tagged you in a picture.

441
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,691
What is tagging? What is tagging?

442
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,072
Why are you drinking
out of a funnel?

443
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,867
And why is his hand on your-

444
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,456
Untag it! Un- Untag it!
Oh, my goodness!

445
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,375
Girls, I'm serious!
Untag it! Tear down the wall!

446
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,290
