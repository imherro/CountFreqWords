1
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:10,743
Yo, the shit is late.

2
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:12,642
They're still vialing up.

3
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:16,112
Usually come off the train street-ready,
but this time they gotta vial.

4
00:00:16,215 --> 00:00:18,410
Y'all got any testers, man?

5
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:19,984
-Yeah, later.
-Later?

6
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:21,413
Got any testers, man?

7
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,785
Nigger, it ain't even 9:00,
and you fiending on it.

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,017
Get the fuck out of here, man. Damn.

9
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,189
Why you act like that?

10
00:00:30,963 --> 00:00:32,692
What, for these junkie motherfuckers?

11
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,859
So you just gonna take his money all day
and treat him like a dog?

12
00:00:35,968 --> 00:00:37,993
-How I'm supposed to treat him?
-I don't know.

13
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:40,902
-But you ain't got to punk him like that.
-He punked himself.

14
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:44,408
He's a goddamn drug addict.
And you a goddamn drug dealer.

15
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:47,237
So? So what?

16
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,174
What, the customer's always right?

17
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:53,217
We're in the projects.

18
00:00:53,352 --> 00:00:56,913
The customer be fucked up.
You can't give these niggers shit, man.

19
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,522
Why not? Why can't you?

20
00:01:00,993 --> 00:01:04,554
Shit, everything else in the world get sold
without people taking advantage.

21
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:07,656
Scamming, lying, doing each other dirty.

22
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:12,030
-Why has it got to be that way with this?
-'Cause they dope fiends.

23
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:15,505
Yeah, but the game
ain't gotta be played like that.

24
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:19,643
You can't tell me this shit can't get done
without people beating on each other...

25
00:01:19,745 --> 00:01:22,407
killing each other,
doing each other like dogs.

26
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:24,279
Without all that...

27
00:01:24,383 --> 00:01:27,546
you ain't got 5-0 here on our backs
every five minutes...

28
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:30,855
-throwing us around and shit.
-Shit, man.

29
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:33,858
You think 5-0 would care
about niggers getting high?

30
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,257
In the projects?

31
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:38,353
Man, 5-0 be down here
about the bodies.

32
00:01:38,464 --> 00:01:41,194
That's what they be
down here about, the bodies.

33
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,861
-Squires, young squires.
-What you want, nigger?

34
00:01:45,838 --> 00:01:49,205
A little bag of styles, man,
a little bag of styles for you.

35
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:52,634
Check it out.

36
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:56,707
Only $5, what's up with that?

37
00:01:56,816 --> 00:02:00,252
$5 make you
a gallant motherfucker, right there, boy.

38
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:05,020
Him, we know.

39
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,928
What are we facing from the riot?

40
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:00,630
Three witnesses' statements...

41
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,935
all of them saying the officer's assault...

42
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,805
on the youth was unprovoked.

43
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,468
You know how that goes, Commissioner.

44
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,309
People's idea of police brutality is
whenever we win a fight.

45
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,882
What does the state's attorney say?

46
00:04:10,983 --> 00:04:12,644
He says it goes to a grand jury.

47
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,481
That's him doing Pontius Pilate.

48
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,715
The grand jury doesn't indict,
he looks clean for passing the buck.

49
00:04:17,823 --> 00:04:19,950
-And if they do indict?
-They won't.

50
00:04:21,293 --> 00:04:23,818
Criminal histories on our three witnesses...

51
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:25,829
one longer than the next.

52
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:27,660
Drugs, weapons, assault...

53
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:28,961
more drugs.

54
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:31,332
Shitbirds throwing dirt at good police.

55
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,234
Just the same, Lieutenant...

56
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:34,306
I want you to rethink...

57
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:37,740
whatever tactic led you to send
three plainclothes officers...

58
00:04:37,843 --> 00:04:42,280
to do field interviews at the high-rises
at 2:00 in the morning.

59
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,017
Yes, sir.

60
00:04:45,117 --> 00:04:47,381
I take it your people have union counsel?

61
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:48,954
Yes, sir.

62
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,548
Sir, I would request...

63
00:04:51,957 --> 00:04:53,754
that pending the grand jury review...

64
00:04:53,859 --> 00:04:56,828
Officer Pryzbylewski be placed
on administrative leave.

65
00:04:56,929 --> 00:05:00,160
I can use him in-office,
but we shouldn't have him on the street...

66
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:01,528
until the grand jury signs off.

67
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:06,503
That's putting our tail between our legs.
I think our official stance has to be...

68
00:05:06,605 --> 00:05:08,300
he did nothing wrong out there.

69
00:05:08,407 --> 00:05:10,204
A 14-year-old is half-blind.

70
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:12,334
And two of ours were injured as well.

71
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:15,642
Goddamn right.
They were fucking shooting at us out there.

72
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,246
Bobby, what do you think?

73
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,045
Keep him off the streets...

74
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:22,120
until it clears the courthouse.

75
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:25,154
Okay, then, we'll wait on the grand jury.

76
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,131
Lieutenant. A moment, please.

77
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,731
What happened out there?

78
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:44,174
Did you know they were in the high-rises
without backup?

79
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,208
If I tell you yes...

80
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:50,509
I screwed up.

81
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,080
If I tell you no...

82
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:54,277
I'm putting my men in the jackpot.

83
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:57,189
Do you still want me to answer?

84
00:06:03,562 --> 00:06:04,529
I screwed up, sir.

85
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,791
Good man,
willing to take one for the company.

86
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,264
To hell with the company.

87
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,631
I'm defending my own people here,
that's all.

88
00:06:10,736 --> 00:06:14,797
What Major Valchek means to say
is that he's grateful that you...

89
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:18,308
extended your support
on behalf of Officer Pryzbylewski.

90
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,708
-Fuck-up that he is.
-He should be off the street.

91
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,644
What can I say? The kid needs...

92
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:25,080
a little guidance, a little supervision.

93
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:28,882
Stan here thought that if he got
a young officer back on the street...

94
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,114
where he might start over--

95
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:32,622
A new unit, a new lieutenant.

96
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:36,593
-You know, that it might bring him around.
-I understand he messed up here.

97
00:06:36,695 --> 00:06:38,060
I understand that.

98
00:06:38,864 --> 00:06:40,832
Which is why I'm saying to you...

99
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,025
I owe you...

100
00:06:42,134 --> 00:06:44,659
for walking him
through this grand jury thing.

101
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,102
And to compensate,
Southeastern is sending you...

102
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:50,539
two new unmarked units,
and a surveillance van.

103
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,304
Plus, you need manpower...

104
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:55,073
while these guys are busy
with this lID thing...

105
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:56,545
all you do is ask.

106
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,247
Lieutenant.

107
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:04,848
So I've got suction with you, Valchek?

108
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,150
That's what I'm saying.

109
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:11,254
Deputy, always a pleasure.

110
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:21,132
A necessary evil.

111
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:24,575
-What?
-Valchek.

112
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,774
Is it insubordinate
if I ask what's so necessary?

113
00:07:29,548 --> 00:07:32,016
Thanks for not cutting Pryzbylewski loose.

114
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:36,113
If you had, the department would be caught
between Valchek and city hall.

115
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:37,655
I owe you for that.

116
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:39,688
This Barksdale...

117
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,187
he's dug in.

118
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,628
It may take more than buy-bust.

119
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,993
And since it's been
in the press about the witness--

120
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:47,463
It's not an issue.

121
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,635
Keep it a tight little circle.

122
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,933
Give me three weeks of good street work
and you'll see this through.

123
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,838
A couple of felony warrants,
a little dope on the table.

124
00:07:57,943 --> 00:07:59,604
That's all we need here.

125
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:03,773
Under no circumstances
is it accurate to suggest...

126
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:07,148
that this particular homicide
was the result of the victim...

127
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,687
having been a witness in an earlier case.

128
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:13,248
Reports to the contrary
are without factual merit.

129
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:18,363
Are you saying that you know definitely
that this man was not killed...

130
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:19,658
because he testified?

131
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:20,857
We think that...

132
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:22,331
I mean, that is...

133
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,902
we're looking into the
possibility that Mr. Gant...

134
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,063
was involved in a street dispute.

135
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:29,830
Which, of course,
would have nothing to do...

136
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:31,375
with his being a witness...

137
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:34,241
in an unrelated case
that concluded weeks ago.

138
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:37,511
But you haven't developed
a suspect at this time?

139
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,412
No, we haven't.

140
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,921
Bunk, shame on you, lad.

141
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:45,516
What did you expect him to do?

142
00:08:45,624 --> 00:08:46,955
I don't know, grab the mike...

143
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,550
shove Rawls to the ground,
declare that all of Baltimore...

144
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:52,927
should rise as one because
they're murdering witnesses in cold blood.

145
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,398
That sounds more like one of your moves.

146
00:08:59,204 --> 00:09:01,832
Been working on him two weeks,
we don't even have a photo.

147
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,636
It's fucking embarrassing.

148
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,172
Hey, Pat.

149
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,880
We got a job for you guys
to try to run down.

150
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:10,949
What is it?

151
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,109
We need a photo of this guy, Barksdale.

152
00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:14,845
We need to know what he looks like.

153
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:18,151
-So go down to the B of l.
-You see, that's the problem, guys.

154
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:20,248
Barksdale's never been arrested
as an adult...

155
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,224
so we don't really have a B of I photo.

156
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:25,764
He had his juvenile record expunged,
so there's no photo there either.

157
00:09:25,864 --> 00:09:27,297
Then you're fucked.

158
00:09:30,135 --> 00:09:31,329
Yeah, we are.

159
00:09:32,037 --> 00:09:36,337
But seeing as we all came into work today,
I thought, let's try something different.

160
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:39,834
We know from his mother's
social service record...

161
00:09:39,945 --> 00:09:42,743
that Barksdale grew up
in Franklin Terrace, right?

162
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,512
It occurred to me...

163
00:09:45,617 --> 00:09:48,711
being vaguely familiar
with the high-rises of West Baltimore...

164
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:51,381
that the housing project
began to take photos...

165
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,323
of every registered resident
as a security measure.

166
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,660
-Am I correct, Detective Greggs?
-Yeah.

167
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:00,591
So you want us to go down
to the housing department...

168
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:02,792
-and pull his photo.
-Excellent.

169
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:07,362
You know, you and l, we think as one.
We're like two horses together in a harness.

170
00:10:08,907 --> 00:10:11,137
Why don't you fucking do it yourself?

171
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:14,835
Sure, if you don't mind sitting in my desk,
reviewing homicide folders...

172
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:18,075
taking meticulous notes,
trying to run down a few new leads.

173
00:10:18,183 --> 00:10:20,743
It's boring, painstaking work,
but if you don't want...

174
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:23,720
to travel to the housing department,
I'll switch with you.

175
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:29,059
Fuck it, Patrick. Let's take a ride.

176
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:41,304
-That was inspiring.
-I'm a leader of men.

177
00:10:52,384 --> 00:10:54,750
-What's up with shop?
-No re-up.

178
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,818
-Why not?
-'Cause we out of red caps.

179
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:00,016
Stink say we gonna have
a new package tomorrow.

180
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,251
New package?

181
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:04,824
Yeah, man, this weak-ass stepped-on shit
we got out here...

182
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,591
get these fiends agitated.

183
00:11:06,698 --> 00:11:08,632
Look at them, they still buying it, though.

184
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:12,192
Yes, they're buying twice as much
and only getting half as high.

185
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:14,171
What was that?

186
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,206
Castle can't move like that.

187
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,470
Castle move up and down or sideways like.

188
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:23,480
-No, we ain't playing that.
-Look at the board, we're playing checkers.

189
00:11:23,715 --> 00:11:25,580
-Checkers?
-Yeah, checkers.

190
00:11:25,784 --> 00:11:27,843
Why're y'all playing checkers
on a chess set?

191
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:29,113
Why do you give a shit?

192
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,848
Man, we ain't got no checkers.

193
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:33,254
Yeah, but chess is a better game.

194
00:11:33,425 --> 00:11:34,392
So?

195
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,593
No, hold up.

196
00:11:36,795 --> 00:11:38,695
Y'all don't know
how to play chess, do you?

197
00:11:38,797 --> 00:11:41,322
-So?
-So, nothing, man.

198
00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:44,630
-I'll teach y'all if you want to learn.
-Come on, man. No, come on.

199
00:11:44,736 --> 00:11:47,830
-We're right in the middle of a game.
-Chill out, I want to see this.

200
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,431
Y'all can't be
playing no checkers on no chessboard.

201
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:51,804
All right, man.

202
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,435
Look, check it, it's simple.

203
00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:56,505
See this?

204
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,350
This is the kingpin.

205
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:01,547
And he the man.

206
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:04,649
You get the other dude's king,
you got the game.

207
00:12:04,756 --> 00:12:07,884
But he's trying to get your king, too,
so you gotta protect it.

208
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:10,757
Now the king, he moves one space...

209
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:13,696
any direction he damn choose,
'cause he's the king.

210
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:16,025
Like this, all right?

211
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,727
But he ain't got no hustle...

212
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:19,997
but the rest of these
motherfuckers on the team...

213
00:12:20,105 --> 00:12:20,906
they got his back.

214
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:24,006
And they run so deep,
he really ain't gotta do shit.

215
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:26,873
-Like your uncle.
-Yeah, like my uncle.

216
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,713
You see this? This is the queen.

217
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,680
She's smart and she's fierce.

218
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,847
She moves any way she wants,
as far as she wants.

219
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:38,147
And she is the go-get-shit-done piece.

220
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,449
Remind me of Stringer.

221
00:12:41,593 --> 00:12:43,720
And this, over here, is the castle.

222
00:12:44,596 --> 00:12:46,257
It's like the stash.

223
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,699
It moves like this.

224
00:12:49,234 --> 00:12:50,565
And like this.

225
00:12:51,336 --> 00:12:53,236
Dog, stash don't move, man.

226
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:54,663
Come on, think.

227
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:57,037
How many times we move
the stash house this week?

228
00:12:57,142 --> 00:12:59,235
And every time we move the stash...

229
00:12:59,344 --> 00:13:01,812
we got to move a little muscle with it
to protect it.

230
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,404
True, you're right.

231
00:13:04,082 --> 00:13:07,313
All right. What about them little
bald-headed bitches right there?

232
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:08,886
These right here.

233
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,788
These are the pawns.
They're like the soldiers.

234
00:13:13,358 --> 00:13:16,293
They move like this,
one space forward only...

235
00:13:16,461 --> 00:13:17,826
except when they fight.

236
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:18,954
Then it's like...

237
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:20,622
or like this.

238
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,695
And they like the front lines.
They be out in the field.

239
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,633
So how do you get to be the king?

240
00:13:25,837 --> 00:13:27,168
It ain't like that.

241
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:30,506
See, the king stays the king, all right?

242
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,400
Everything stays who he is...

243
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:34,001
except for the pawns.

244
00:13:34,112 --> 00:13:35,443
Now if a pawn...

245
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:38,548
makes it all the way down
to the other dude's side...

246
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,242
he gets to be queen.

247
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:44,151
And like I said, the queen ain't no bitch.

248
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:46,089
She got all the moves.

249
00:13:46,191 --> 00:13:47,658
All right, so...

250
00:13:48,393 --> 00:13:51,191
if I make it to the other end, I win?

251
00:13:51,396 --> 00:13:56,060
If you catch the other dude's king
and trap it, then you win.

252
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,632
But if I make it to the end...

253
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:00,768
I'm top dog.

254
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:02,971
No, it ain't like that, look.

255
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,937
The pawns, man, in the game...

256
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:08,470
they get capped quick.

257
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,811
They be out of the game early.

258
00:14:12,584 --> 00:14:14,950
Unless they're some smart-ass pawns.

259
00:14:22,794 --> 00:14:25,024
Nagras. Can you fucking believe this?

260
00:14:25,597 --> 00:14:27,326
This shit is prehistoric.

261
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:29,992
What else have they got
down there in Property?

262
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:33,469
Eight-tracks? Victrolas?
That fucking department's a joke.

263
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,164
We got to get with the feds somehow.

264
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:38,437
They got light-weights,
wireless micro-recorders.

265
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,437
Yeah, DEA got those.

266
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,840
If I wear this on a warm day,
they're gonna know.

267
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:45,473
Even if they do a half-assed search,
I'm done.

268
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:46,551
Nagras.

269
00:14:46,985 --> 00:14:47,917
Jesus.

270
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,319
You can't send his ass into the projects
with this shit taped to him.

271
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:52,981
That ain't gonna play.

272
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:54,449
I'm saying.

273
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,049
McNulty and the girl...

274
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:58,391
the lezzer from narcotics,
they've got the file.

275
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:00,727
-Who are you partnered with?
-McNulty.

276
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:05,493
But he don't have shit to do with me and
I don't want nothing to do with him neither.

277
00:15:06,271 --> 00:15:09,900
Major, I'm a fifth wheel
on a car that's going nowhere.

278
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:11,837
Bring me home.

279
00:15:12,744 --> 00:15:13,904
Soon enough.

280
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:17,446
Look, you're my eyes and ears
in this mess, right?

281
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:20,609
And I don't want no more surprises,
like that newspaper article.

282
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:23,153
If McNulty's planning
any more bullshit like that...

283
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,452
I got to be able to tell the deputy
before the shit flies.

284
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:29,654
Then you come home
with a favor in your pocket.

285
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:31,225
How bad is that?

286
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:03,353
Lieutenant.

287
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:08,526
You get Carver and Prez back tomorrow,
but Prez is in-office.

288
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:11,101
No police powers, no street work, nothing.

289
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,033
If the building catches fire,
he stays in the office.

290
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,869
-What about Herc?
-Medical, until Monday at least.

291
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:25,283
I wonder what you gotta do
to get thrown off this police force.

292
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:29,612
Keep on with some of your shit,
you just might find out.

293
00:16:30,288 --> 00:16:32,347
Where are the fucking run sheets?

294
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:34,756
Behind the board.

295
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:39,591
You all go for a taste?

296
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:45,426
We got your picture,
don't you fucking worry, McNulty.

297
00:16:52,477 --> 00:16:53,739
This is Barksdale?

298
00:16:53,845 --> 00:16:55,540
Avon Barksdale.

299
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:57,949
I don't think so.

300
00:16:58,049 --> 00:16:59,243
Read my lips.

301
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,444
Avon fucking Barksdale.

302
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,384
His name's on the form in the file.

303
00:17:03,488 --> 00:17:05,046
Excuse me for giving a shit...

304
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:08,422
but I can't help but notice
this is a middle-aged white man.

305
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,857
You want something different,
you give me another name.

306
00:17:11,963 --> 00:17:15,990
That's the only Avon Barksdale
in the housing department files.

307
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,961
You got your smokes?

308
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,333
Have a nice fucking day.

309
00:17:27,412 --> 00:17:28,743
Maybe he's white.

310
00:17:33,151 --> 00:17:35,711
No, I mean, really. What do we really know?

311
00:17:37,088 --> 00:17:38,385
"Avon Barksdale.

312
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,684
"31 years of age.

313
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,123
"Born Provident Hospital, West Baltimore...

314
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,627
"to Willette Jackson Barksdale...

315
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,387
"father unknown.

316
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,556
"Educated Baltimore city schools."

317
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:52,125
Address is in the same public housing
where he controls the drug trade.

318
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,864
No flash, no profile.

319
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,136
Pretty much comes up out of nowhere.

320
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:00,507
No work history.
No tax information we can look at.

321
00:18:01,379 --> 00:18:03,506
No cars in his name, no driver's license.

322
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:04,639
No kids.

323
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,616
No priors either.

324
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,054
Yeah, here's this vague CI information...

325
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:13,419
that states he stays in
various apartments out in the county.

326
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:15,755
Addresses undetermined, of course.

327
00:18:16,127 --> 00:18:18,459
He moves from girlfriend to girlfriend...

328
00:18:18,563 --> 00:18:21,088
might have another girlfriend in New York.

329
00:18:21,766 --> 00:18:23,063
He likes to work out...

330
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:26,103
and he used to box Golden Gloves
when he was younger.

331
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:31,201
I've been working on him for two weeks
and the truth is, we don't know shit.

332
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:32,537
Golden Gloves?

333
00:18:34,312 --> 00:18:35,870
How did you hear that?

334
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:37,542
I don't know.

335
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:41,248
I think I got that from a DEA File.

336
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,082
Or from a Cl...

337
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:46,987
who claimed to know him way back when.

338
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,425
So you write everything down?

339
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,265
Yeah, everything.

340
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:04,008
-Goddamn bomb, y'all.
-Blue-tops, blue-tops.

341
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:05,706
Double shorts.

342
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,175
In the hole, man.

343
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,370
Got blue-tops. Looking for blues?

344
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,972
In the hole, y'all.

345
00:19:12,717 --> 00:19:14,184
-Blue-tops.
-Red-tops.

346
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:19,587
-Red-tops.
-Two for $10.

347
00:19:20,892 --> 00:19:22,382
Blue-tops, blue-tops.

348
00:19:46,484 --> 00:19:47,974
Keep your jab moving.

349
00:19:50,388 --> 00:19:53,050
Move with your right. Left, right, left, right.

350
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:54,718
Two punches.

351
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:04,926
I got a few questions
I wanna ask you, Mack.

352
00:20:05,036 --> 00:20:07,266
Keep your hands moving,
work to the body some.

353
00:20:07,872 --> 00:20:09,271
So who's your target?

354
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,807
-Barksdale.
-Who?

355
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:12,408
Avon Barksdale.

356
00:20:12,877 --> 00:20:14,868
-Never heard of him.
-That's the thing.

357
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,005
This guy's got
the Westside projects locked up.

358
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:20,141
He's tied to maybe a dozen murders,
he's completely off the radar.

359
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:21,980
-Avon, what was it?
-Barksdale.

360
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:23,213
If you say so.

361
00:20:23,321 --> 00:20:24,723
DEA has a couple of pages
on him from NADDIS entries.

362
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,213
DEA has a couple of pages
on him from NADDIS entries.

363
00:20:26,324 --> 00:20:28,918
Nothing in NCIC, no adult arrests.

364
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,589
I've been working drugs
for the Bureau since '98.

365
00:20:31,696 --> 00:20:34,631
I can tell you, we got
nothing on him that I know.

366
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,101
This little thing...

367
00:20:37,335 --> 00:20:39,030
is the smile of the week.

368
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:40,297
Watch this.

369
00:20:42,607 --> 00:20:44,165
-What?
-What was that?

370
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:46,140
Get the door.

371
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:55,346
It's a career case.

372
00:20:55,453 --> 00:20:57,751
Not that my bosses
give a damn at this point.

373
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:58,914
Why not?

374
00:20:59,357 --> 00:21:00,324
Why not?

375
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,986
All of them mopes in bracelets
and not one of them named Osama.

376
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,461
I owe you, brother. What do you need?

377
00:21:06,564 --> 00:21:10,261
A couple of lightweight body mikes.
Wireless, remote taping capability.

378
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:11,594
That's all?

379
00:21:12,937 --> 00:21:15,963
Where I come from,
we're just happy to be in the 20th century.

380
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:19,043
Who's running the case,
so I can tell my squad supervisor?

381
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:21,476
Daniels, out of Narcotics.

382
00:21:24,382 --> 00:21:25,849
All right, no problem.

383
00:21:30,321 --> 00:21:32,118
Shit! Fucking rain, man.

384
00:21:32,223 --> 00:21:34,214
All right, y'all know what the fuck this is.

385
00:21:34,325 --> 00:21:37,453
-Up against the wall, hurry the fuck up.
-Come on, let's go.

386
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:40,258
Go on to the back.
Ain't got time for this shit.

387
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,630
Got some red-tops, some testers.
Get them around the corner.

388
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:47,068
Hurry up, take them around.

389
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:49,533
What the fuck you looking at me for?

390
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,609
Get your ass around the corner.

391
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,120
I want that shit, that's good.

392
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,216
Keep it moving.

393
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:25,875
-Man, you see that?
-Yeah.

394
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:29,307
Third from the end. That's the stash.

395
00:22:29,914 --> 00:22:32,144
Some real raggedy-ass shit here, boy.

396
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:34,043
Very sloppy.

397
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:42,054
How old are your kids?

398
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,551
Mike is 8, Sean's 10.

399
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:47,061
That's the hard part.

400
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:49,395
Yeah, that's the hard part, but you know....

401
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:52,629
-How often do you get to see them?
-Every other weekend.

402
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:55,202
Trying to get more, but she's fighting me.

403
00:22:55,306 --> 00:22:58,241
-Why would she fight you on that?
-She's getting even.

404
00:22:58,777 --> 00:22:59,971
Getting even?

405
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:02,069
You must've been fucking around.

406
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:04,482
-I'm just saying.
-You're right.

407
00:23:04,749 --> 00:23:05,909
It's always the case.

408
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:08,850
A woman wants to get even,
there's something extra there.

409
00:23:08,953 --> 00:23:12,252
How come you got all this wisdom
and your life's so fucking hard?

410
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:14,484
I've been wondering on that myself.

411
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,629
How about you? You ever been married?

412
00:23:23,968 --> 00:23:25,026
What'd I say?

413
00:23:25,136 --> 00:23:27,468
-If you ain't gonna say anything, I am.
-What?

414
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,234
If you're a dog,
you barking at the wrong pussy.

415
00:23:30,508 --> 00:23:32,066
What, so I'm a dog now?

416
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:34,372
-Meow.
-Bubbles.

417
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,706
I date women.

418
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:39,750
We've got something else in common.
I date women, too.

419
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:42,752
So pretty much everyone in CID
has worked this out but me?

420
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:45,414
There wasn't nothing to figure out.
I told them.

421
00:23:45,523 --> 00:23:49,653
-I guess I missed the press conference.
-It's better that than to have every police...

422
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,787
on three shifts hounding you
every goddamned day.

423
00:23:53,731 --> 00:23:56,029
-Cops are dogs.
-Yeah.

424
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:58,031
It's not like I was walking around...

425
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:00,730
waving some dyke flag in the air,
or some shit.

426
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:07,243
-I know I look like I could go either way.
-Lord, yes, you do. Yes, you do.

427
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:10,280
It was something I had to put out there
to get through the day.

428
00:24:10,381 --> 00:24:13,009
-I should've known.
-Should've known what?

429
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:17,779
I worked with one other female police officer
who was worth a damn, only one.

430
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:19,322
-A lesbian.
-Yeah.

431
00:24:25,129 --> 00:24:27,723
In the beginning, you're in your radio car...

432
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,295
alone, working your post.

433
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,195
-Most women aren't getting out of that car.
-Right.

434
00:24:33,404 --> 00:24:35,634
Not without side partners showing up.

435
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:38,909
They're intimidated, physically.

436
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:41,141
-They gotta be.
-You weren't?

437
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:43,314
Yeah, at first.

438
00:24:43,781 --> 00:24:47,547
But I'm talking about some old
straight-out-of-the-academy-type scared...

439
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,676
you know what I'm saying?

440
00:24:48,786 --> 00:24:50,583
I wasn't about to stay scared.

441
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:54,454
You know, you get your ass kicked
once or twice...

442
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,551
you realize
it's not the end of the world, right?

443
00:24:58,696 --> 00:25:01,062
Most of the women,
they don't want to believe that.

444
00:25:01,165 --> 00:25:03,793
Some of the men, too.
They don't even want to go there.

445
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:06,336
-You think 'cause you're gay?
-I don't know.

446
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:09,196
But is there any other fucking way
to police?

447
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:14,271
All I know is I just love the job.

448
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:21,246
-That'll be $3.20.
-Keep the change.

449
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:23,149
Thanks, have a nice day.

450
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,595
Dee coming up.

451
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:31,348
Where's it all go?

452
00:26:34,158 --> 00:26:37,059
The money. Where do all the money go?

453
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:49,672
$22,000 or $24,000, give or take.

454
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:51,574
From the low-rises?

455
00:26:54,545 --> 00:26:57,139
Damn, boy!
You must have that crew humming.

456
00:26:57,248 --> 00:27:00,740
I don't remember a day
we ever got this much from the Courtyard.

457
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:03,714
It wasn't even check day.

458
00:27:03,821 --> 00:27:05,721
You doing good out there, Dee.

459
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:09,151
We'll be doing even better
when we get that new package.

460
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:12,363
New package, same as old, man.

461
00:27:12,663 --> 00:27:14,654
-Say what?
-Ain't no new package.

462
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:18,497
Just gonna put that same shit
out in a different color gelcap is all.

463
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:23,002
Might spike that shit with some procaine
or some caffeine, but otherwise the same.

464
00:27:23,107 --> 00:27:25,598
String, man,
people are already coming back on us...

465
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,372
-telling us that shit is weak.
-I know, the shit is weak.

466
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:30,003
But shit is weak all over.

467
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:34,307
The thing is, no matter what we call heroin,
it's gonna get sold.

468
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:36,579
The shit is strong, we're gonna sell it.

469
00:27:36,687 --> 00:27:38,985
The shit is weak,
we're gonna sell twice as much.

470
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,284
You know why?

471
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:43,655
'Cause a fiend,
he's gonna chase that shit no matter what.

472
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:45,952
It's crazy, you know?

473
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:50,764
We do worse, and we get paid more.

474
00:27:51,402 --> 00:27:55,133
The government do better,
and it don't mean no never mind.

475
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:59,135
This shit right here, Dee, it's forever.

476
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:10,119
That's your bonus right there.

477
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:13,353
And you buy something
that you wouldn't otherwise.

478
00:28:15,526 --> 00:28:16,652
Thanks, man.

479
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:24,394
All right.

480
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,184
You remember me?

481
00:28:45,456 --> 00:28:46,946
Do I remember you?

482
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,855
I was in here the other day,
you wanted a drink.

483
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:54,060
-Did I get a drink?
-Afraid not.

484
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,761
Then why would I remember you?

485
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:00,963
You want to be remembered,
you going about it the wrong way here.

486
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,096
All right.

487
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:11,405
The usual.

488
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:14,281
This here's my uncle's place.

489
00:29:14,418 --> 00:29:15,908
You kin to Orlando?

490
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:17,621
No.

491
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:24,887
Orlando's like the up-front man, you know?
My uncle's the money man.

492
00:29:30,968 --> 00:29:33,129
-Where you from?
-Right here.

493
00:29:33,871 --> 00:29:37,204
-Baltimore.
-I know Baltimore, but, like, where?

494
00:29:38,242 --> 00:29:39,937
You know Turner Station?

495
00:29:42,146 --> 00:29:44,205
Down past Dundalk, near the Point.

496
00:29:44,348 --> 00:29:47,806
The Point. So, you're a country girl.

497
00:29:48,352 --> 00:29:52,482
-You mean county.
-Where I'm from, the county is the country.

498
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:54,019
Where is that?

499
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:00,655
So...

500
00:30:03,267 --> 00:30:05,258
are you working with your uncle?

501
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,603
I'm his right hand.

502
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,481
Yes, you is.

503
00:30:25,022 --> 00:30:27,183
You want to ride with us in the van?

504
00:30:27,758 --> 00:30:30,318
-No.
-Why not?

505
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:33,054
You think it's a waste?

506
00:30:33,831 --> 00:30:36,527
Touts and children,
that's all you're gonna get.

507
00:30:43,307 --> 00:30:44,467
Bingo.

508
00:30:49,413 --> 00:30:51,005
Where did you get this?

509
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:06,587
Now, look at this piece of shit.

510
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:09,356
I'm good to go, right?

511
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,560
Come here, let me see.

512
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:15,603
Detective Sydnor's ensemble.

513
00:31:15,706 --> 00:31:18,334
It's the latest in Westside Project wear.

514
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,603
Have your torn cammies by Versace...

515
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,010
stained sweatshirt by Ralph Lauren.

516
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:28,013
-Where you miked?
-Down in my dick, man.

517
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:30,212
I figure they ain't gonna
go down there, right?

518
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:33,256
I don't know, Sydnor,
the way you twirling around...

519
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,518
might be the first place they look.

520
00:31:35,726 --> 00:31:36,715
Fuck you.

521
00:31:38,195 --> 00:31:41,130
I ain't showered in two days,
I ain't shaved in four.

522
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:45,200
Right now, I am one ripe,
nasty son of a bitch.

523
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:47,696
Bubbs.

524
00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:49,901
What you think?

525
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:52,999
This your man?

526
00:31:53,844 --> 00:31:54,970
Yeah.

527
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,939
Is he low-bottom enough for you?

528
00:31:58,949 --> 00:32:01,179
Clothes is tore down enough...

529
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:04,846
but he could use a little bit more stains,
more dirt.

530
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:11,055
-What's this here, man?
-It's my wedding ring.

531
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:15,594
Shit, you married to the needle, boy.

532
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,466
That shit been pawned off, if you for real.

533
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:20,203
It's a dead giveaway.

534
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:24,803
You could stand to lose about 20 pounds,
some yellow in your teeth...

535
00:32:25,242 --> 00:32:26,937
fresh bleeds on your hands.

536
00:32:27,244 --> 00:32:30,543
So maybe I should go out
and shoot up dope for a year or two, right?

537
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:34,482
-Come back when I can carry the look off?
-I'm just saying, man.

538
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,686
The more tore down you look, the better.

539
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:41,919
You going down in them towers,
they gonna check everything.

540
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:43,425
How about the shoes?

541
00:32:43,527 --> 00:32:47,293
I know you ain't got no problem
with the shoes, fucked up as they are.

542
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:49,293
Let me see the shoes, man.

543
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,496
See?

544
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,797
You walking down them alleys
of the projects...

545
00:32:55,906 --> 00:32:57,897
you stepping on the dead soldiers.

546
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:01,040
-Dead soldiers?
-Yeah, empty vials.

547
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:05,275
You can't walk down a Baltimore street
without them cracking underneath your feet.

548
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:07,613
You want to know if a fiend is for real...

549
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:09,652
check the bottom of his shoes.

550
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:13,216
Okay.

551
00:33:13,357 --> 00:33:16,349
Have him dance on some empties
before we go out there.

552
00:33:17,094 --> 00:33:18,561
Get us killed.

553
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:22,732
He hurt your feelings?

554
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:24,061
A little bit.

555
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:30,030
Shit.

556
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:01,821
Four hand-to-hands...

557
00:35:02,032 --> 00:35:05,524
two to me, two to Bubbs,
with me close enough to mark it.

558
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,663
-From who?
-Kids, mostly.

559
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:10,531
Young-ass hoppers.

560
00:35:11,308 --> 00:35:12,468
It's a start.

561
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,810
They're pretty tight out here, Kima.

562
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:17,346
If you don't hand no money
to nobody that matters...

563
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:20,315
you don't get no product
from nobody that matters.

564
00:35:23,153 --> 00:35:24,711
You want to go back in?

565
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:27,916
Shit, we copped from every crew out here.

566
00:35:30,427 --> 00:35:33,760
Ain't we supposed to go off somewhere
and fire this shit up?

567
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:38,929
Yeah, let's get the fuck out of here.

568
00:35:52,716 --> 00:35:54,013
Well, now.

569
00:35:57,421 --> 00:36:00,754
Did you get to see where the money went
after you handed it off?

570
00:36:01,525 --> 00:36:02,685
No.

571
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,489
Nothing but touts and runners here.

572
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:11,692
But then again, you told us so.

573
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:13,930
I didn't say that.

574
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,731
But as a matter of fact....

575
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:30,218
-Everyone else roll out?
-I--

576
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:35,859
You were upstairs and out of pocket,
so I cut them loose.

577
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,261
Just as well.
I'll give them the news tomorrow.

578
00:36:39,496 --> 00:36:40,724
What happened?

579
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,933
I told the Deputy we had
a few hand-to-hands.

580
00:36:43,033 --> 00:36:44,057
Low-level people.

581
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:47,035
He wants us to put everything
into search-and-seizures...

582
00:36:47,137 --> 00:36:48,627
and hit the projects Wednesday afternoon.

583
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:50,104
-Lieutenant.
-I know.

584
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:52,971
Does he think that's what
gets us Avon Barksdale?

585
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:56,305
The buys we made,
they don't even go past the courtyards.

586
00:36:57,348 --> 00:37:00,681
Scratch together everything
we got from the hand-to-hands...

587
00:37:00,784 --> 00:37:03,150
and shape it into PC for the warrants.

588
00:37:03,253 --> 00:37:04,914
A few locations, at least.

589
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:07,456
But we don't even know what doors to hit.

590
00:37:08,525 --> 00:37:11,892
A few apartments in the low-rises
that we've seen used for stash.

591
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:13,190
Then we write on those.

592
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:16,130
Lieutenant, these guys change
stash houses every other day.

593
00:37:16,233 --> 00:37:19,225
Look, the man upstairs wants to see
a circus.

594
00:37:19,336 --> 00:37:22,396
A couple of days from now,
I got to show him three rings.

595
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:23,734
Christ.

596
00:37:26,243 --> 00:37:28,803
I'm sorry. We gotta jump.

597
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:44,251
-What, is the Deputy Ops stupid?
-No.

598
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:46,262
This shit is fucking stupid.

599
00:37:46,363 --> 00:37:47,796
Not if we bring in some arrests...

600
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:50,765
he takes them to the judge,
he figures the judge goes away.

601
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:53,564
And then he buries the fucking case.

602
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:58,642
What are we gonna do?

603
00:37:58,742 --> 00:38:02,041
There's nothing you can do,
except pound out some probable cause.

604
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:04,910
-We're gonna be here all fucking night.
-I'm not.

605
00:38:05,582 --> 00:38:08,073
-Where the fuck you got to go?
-No, I mean, I can't.

606
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:10,585
I'm not gonna help them gut the case.
I'm sorry.

607
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:13,418
I know he's your lieutenant.
You gotta do what you gotta do.

608
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:15,788
But I can't swallow this shit anymore.

609
00:38:50,527 --> 00:38:53,985
-Why are you here?
-I'm thinking about something.

610
00:38:54,264 --> 00:38:56,164
-Can I come in?
-No.

611
00:38:57,267 --> 00:38:58,256
No?

612
00:38:59,069 --> 00:39:01,629
What's the matter, McNulty?
No one ever tells you "no"?

613
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,764
Sorry. I should've called.

614
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:09,072
How do you clone a beeper?

615
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:11,272
-What?
-That's what I need to know.

616
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:15,083
You show up at my door at 9:00
to ask me that?

617
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:16,550
They're using pagers, right?

618
00:39:16,653 --> 00:39:20,612
Every other drug dealer has a cell phone,
and these guys are all on pagers.

619
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:26,426
What do you want to do?

620
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:29,655
Bunk and me, when we jack up
the Barksdale kid...

621
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:31,325
he's got a Motorola pager.

622
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:33,665
We give it back, so as not to spook him.

623
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:35,494
You want to clone it?

624
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,740
Can we do that without a subpoena
to the pager company?

625
00:39:43,947 --> 00:39:45,107
Read that.

626
00:39:46,316 --> 00:39:49,080
-What is it?
-Affidavit from a state police case.

627
00:39:49,386 --> 00:39:52,583
A judge signs something like that,
you can clone a beeper.

628
00:39:52,689 --> 00:39:53,781
Christ.

629
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,758
Probable cause,
coupled with an exhaustion argument.

630
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,862
You've got to show the judge
that other investigative methods have failed.

631
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:05,166
You'll also need a supervisor
who wants you to clone a suspect's pager...

632
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:07,794
knowing that it might lead
to who knows what else...

633
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,566
pen registers, wiretaps.

634
00:40:09,973 --> 00:40:11,565
Daniels will come around.

635
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,771
Daniels will have your ass.

636
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:19,649
Thanks.

637
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,440
-That's it?
-What?

638
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,282
No.

639
00:40:41,471 --> 00:40:42,836
Let me understand.

640
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,971
You're married,
and a date's a room at the Best Western.

641
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:50,876
Now you're single, and a date
is you coming over unannounced...

642
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:54,109
to learn the legal requisites
for a pager intercept.

643
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:56,451
Pretty much.

644
00:40:58,055 --> 00:40:59,022
No.

645
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:04,258
Okay, I hear you.

646
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,458
You?

647
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:46,926
As if you give a shit.

648
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:09,990
You're an asshole, McNulty.

649
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,955
What the fuck did I do?

650
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:22,394
-How much more to that pack?
-50, 60.

651
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:24,806
Re-up's late.

652
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:30,302
Have Wallace hit Stinkum
on his pager again.

653
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,445
You want something from carry-out?

654
00:42:32,549 --> 00:42:34,676
Yeah, lake trout sub.

655
00:42:35,218 --> 00:42:36,378
Pay up.

656
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:38,421
Damn.

657
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:40,657
You asked, I thought you was treating.

658
00:42:40,757 --> 00:42:42,884
You thought wrong, I ain't no bank.

659
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,727
You stingy like one.

660
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:47,422
Just make sure you give me enough.

661
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:52,466
-No mayo, extra hot, something to drink.
-All right.

662
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,434
-He's going for food?
-Yes.

663
00:43:00,644 --> 00:43:03,738
Why didn't you tell me?
My stomach's growling like a motherfucker.

664
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:06,145
-Starve, nigger.
-Man, shit.

665
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:07,811
Re-up's here.

666
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:10,081
Stink, what up?

667
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:13,415
What's up, bro? 10 minutes.

668
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:14,624
-10?
-Yeah.

669
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:15,783
All right.

670
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:26,430
Who's there?

671
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:42,944
Y'all got my back, you heard?

672
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,910
Get the fuck in there.

673
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:49,823
Get your ass down.
Sit your stupid ass down.

674
00:43:49,926 --> 00:43:52,759
Get the fuck down. Shit, stay there, bitch.

675
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:56,822
Get down, get the fuck down, motherfucker.

676
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,465
Where it at?

677
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:03,028
-Ain't nothing here.
-Where it at, man?

678
00:44:09,479 --> 00:44:11,606
Shit! Fuck, my leg!

679
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:14,013
Where it at, shorty?

680
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:22,920
-Kitchen, under the sink.
-Go on and get that.

681
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,042
Two G-packs. Let's roll.

682
00:44:39,042 --> 00:44:40,566
Two G-packs. Let's roll.

683
00:44:40,677 --> 00:44:43,612
-Just two?
-Come on.

684
00:44:43,713 --> 00:44:45,442
What the--

685
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:50,083
Stupid.

686
00:45:02,365 --> 00:45:03,662
Shit!

687
00:45:04,734 --> 00:45:06,702
Let's get the fuck out of here.

688
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:09,967
Shit!

689
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,972
Come on, Poot.

690
00:45:21,084 --> 00:45:22,551
Fuck!

691
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:50,536
-So, your man saw them get jacked?
-Yeah, part of it.

692
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:54,310
-And he gets the tag number?
-Good man, that Bubbles.

693
00:45:56,219 --> 00:45:57,413
Listen up.

694
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:02,815
Western uniforms will meet us
in the Mount Claire parking lot.

695
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:05,588
We start there, and we don't stop
until we take the doors.

696
00:46:05,695 --> 00:46:08,528
I want their lookouts
to have as little chance as possible.

697
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,264
What's with you?

698
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:16,695
My office.

699
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:32,151
-I'm not going.
-You're insubordinate?

700
00:46:32,255 --> 00:46:34,985
I'm not jumping out
on something that will harm the case.

701
00:46:35,091 --> 00:46:38,288
-You want to write me up on that, you can.
-You think I want this?

702
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:40,727
I got the Deputy Ops on my ass for this shit.

703
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:43,128
Now you show me up
in front of the whole detail.

704
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:44,894
I don't mean to show anybody up.

705
00:46:45,001 --> 00:46:46,559
-Get your vest on.
-No.

706
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:48,731
I got police work to do.

707
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:52,270
If you felt this way,
why didn't you call in sick?

708
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:53,603
I'm not sick.

709
00:46:54,911 --> 00:46:56,173
Yeah, you are.

710
00:47:02,185 --> 00:47:05,951
Give me a 95 on why you are physically
unable to participate in today's action.

711
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:08,251
What, I'm gonna lie so you can save face?

712
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:09,985
Come on, write it up.

713
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:12,926
"I can't jump out with my unit
because my tummy hurts."

714
00:47:13,029 --> 00:47:14,621
I'm not gonna help you gut this case.

715
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:17,598
If you want to pretend to be police,
you go ahead.

716
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,646
Let's do it.

717
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,253
I'm up.

718
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:47,526
-You're on medical.
-I'm up, boss.

719
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:50,432
Give him a vest.

720
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:07,973
No, motherfucker.
It ain't just up to Stinkum to be muscle.

721
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:09,415
You got the Pit.

722
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:11,817
Your people supposed
to be ready for the re-up.

723
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:15,985
You supposed to be steady for him.
But where you at?

724
00:48:16,092 --> 00:48:18,117
You in the goddamn sandwich shop.

725
00:48:18,361 --> 00:48:21,762
You got $20,000, Dee,
coming into your shop...

726
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:24,493
and you ain't even around
to see that shit right.

727
00:48:24,601 --> 00:48:25,898
Look, I thought re-ups--

728
00:48:26,002 --> 00:48:29,665
No, thinking was what you wasn't doing,
and now we look like bitches.

729
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:32,799
You feel me? We got to come back on them.

730
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:35,503
And you can't even tell me shit
about who they was.

731
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:38,080
One of them was named Omar.

732
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:42,550
-Omar?
-Omar, that's the name I heard.

733
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:46,287
-And they had a white van.
-Yeah, I saw the van--

734
00:48:46,389 --> 00:48:49,290
-What kind of van?
-Five-0.

735
00:49:06,876 --> 00:49:08,537
-Wrong door.
-Yeah?

736
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:10,772
Yeah, switched it yesterday.

737
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:13,747
Let's see your hands.

738
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:15,784
Get out of the way. Let's see your hands.

739
00:49:15,885 --> 00:49:18,581
Up, motherfucker, up. Turn around.

740
00:49:20,323 --> 00:49:22,154
All the way up.

741
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:33,966
Police. Put your hands up. Put them up!

742
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:37,296
Turn your monkey ass around.
Put your hands at your back.

743
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:38,999
Why you fucking with us, man?

744
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:42,044
Come on, man, damn,
I wasn't even doing shit.

745
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:46,740
Come on, man.

746
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:51,076
Cuff that one, and that one.

747
00:49:51,187 --> 00:49:53,985
Motherfucker, how's that feel?

748
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:57,321
You fucked up now. You feel it, right?

749
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:01,727
Why you ain't swinging?

750
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:07,435
Motherfucker. Go ahead,
play that cowboy shit, motherfucker.

751
00:50:08,571 --> 00:50:11,165
Hold him down. Hold his arms!

752
00:50:12,475 --> 00:50:15,444
Spread your legs.
Don't make me kick your ass, too.

753
00:50:15,578 --> 00:50:16,567
Come on!

754
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:20,307
Get him. You don't hit a cop.

755
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:23,113
What's wrong with you, boy?
You wanna hit a cop?

756
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:57,620
If you'd been here earlier,
you'd have seen a beating.

757
00:50:59,622 --> 00:51:01,647
Clean. Not a fucking thing in there.

758
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:04,727
Pick any door in the low-rises.
What are the chances?

759
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:26,742
Channel 2 wants to know if she can film
some of the places we raided.

760
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:29,648
She says whatever we got, she'll put on film.

761
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,614
-Whatever we got?
-Drugs, weapons.

762
00:51:34,023 --> 00:51:35,490
We ain't got shit.

763
00:51:59,482 --> 00:52:01,643
I can tell you were never in patrol.

764
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:03,916
Right.

765
00:52:14,697 --> 00:52:17,029
-Sorry I'm late.
-What's up?

766
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:22,361
I didn't want to tell you in front of the girl,
her being from Narcotics and all.

767
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:24,371
Daniels is dirty.

768
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:26,366
What?

769
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:29,606
The guy running your case,
he's got dirt on him.

770
00:52:30,046 --> 00:52:31,070
You know this?

771
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:34,509
Your own agency came to us with
concerns about him last year.

772
00:52:34,617 --> 00:52:36,084
Integrity questions.

773
00:52:36,286 --> 00:52:40,154
They didn't want to go to lnternal Affairs.
That office leaks like a sieve.

774
00:52:40,256 --> 00:52:43,282
Plus they couldn't handle a case
if their lives depended on it.

775
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:46,123
-That, too.
-You looked at Daniels specifically?

776
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:48,493
We did a two-month assets investigation.

777
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:51,499
The man has a couple hundred thousand
more in liquid assets...

778
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:53,831
than any police lieutenant should ever have.

779
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:57,464
Maybe he goes to Atlantic City. Seriously.

780
00:52:58,041 --> 00:53:01,377
You look at his background?
Maybe he's got other sources of income.

781
00:53:01,544 --> 00:53:03,739
Maybe. We never got the chance
to go further.

782
00:53:03,846 --> 00:53:04,813
Why not?

783
00:53:05,114 --> 00:53:08,743
We went to your Deputy for Operations
and told him what we had.

784
00:53:08,851 --> 00:53:11,786
-You took it to Burrell?
-He says, "We'll take it from here."

785
00:53:11,888 --> 00:53:14,584
So, we backed away and waited
for something to happen.

786
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:17,922
-And waited.
-That was a year ago?

787
00:53:18,294 --> 00:53:19,659
Maybe more.

788
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:22,693
And that fucker's still
the Supervisor for Narcotics.

789
00:53:23,032 --> 00:53:25,466
So, you tell me what the hell's going on.

790
00:53:29,305 --> 00:53:33,173
Anyway, if he's running your case,
I just thought you'd want to know.

791
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:35,044
Thanks.
